* Callback Functions
    Callback Functions are functions that we can use as parameters to other functions. Callback functions need to be of the same and to accept the same number
    of parameters for them to be used in addition to others. Using callback functions, we get to create better and cleaner code because we can write them once
    and call them when needed by importing them for example in a project.
