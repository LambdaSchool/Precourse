# Homework #JSVI

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions

A callback function is how a function can be called to and used within another function that does not originally possess it. It is often denoted in the spot for the variable as cb or callback. It calls back to a different function that it wants to use for the current function.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSVI.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
