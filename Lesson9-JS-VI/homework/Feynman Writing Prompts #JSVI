Callback's are when you use a variable like a function inside
a function. It's like a seesaw because the functions action comes to a near halt and then a callback
is used to re-initiate another function or the same one function again, going back and forth
from one action to another. You'll see these alot in games or things that need alot of graphics where you need to
continue a function but need it to run differently
