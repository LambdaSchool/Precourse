Callback Functions - functions are special because they can do many things, one of those things they can do is act like variables, which means, just like variables can be passsed around, so can functions. not only that but functions can be passed around into other functions as arguments. when you call a function, it can run, and then it can call the other function you passed into it as an argument to run as well. Functions work together this way to do many things, a single function would not be able to do. it is also called higher order functions, coming from a mathematics term.
