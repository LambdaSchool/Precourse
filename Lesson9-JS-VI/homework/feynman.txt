Callback functions are a part of javascript that allows a function to have a function inside of its arguments.
It is more importantly used so you can use a function that can refer to another function within its arguments.
Such as asking for a greeting and then in the callback argument referring to which specific greeting you want
to use that you previously established. Ex. The intial function would be created with something like
greetingFunction(name, cb) and then invoked later with greetingFunction(kevin, happyGreeting) or 
greetingFunction(kevin, rudeGreeting) depending on which callback you wanted to use in conjuction
with your original function.
