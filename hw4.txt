**Objects
objects are variables, contained within curly braces, that contain data in the form
of key and value pairs. Keys must be unique, and values can be strings, arrays,
other objects, functions, etc. The value can be called upon by dot notation using
objectname.key
You can call on it using objectname[key] but the info contained within [] *must*
be a string or a number, or a variable pointing to a string or a number

**Properties
The property is the key:value pair. If you delete object.key the entire entry
is removed from the object.

**Methods
A method is a function on an object. The function is stored as the value on a key, 
and this is called with object.key or object.key(variable) Using array.length
is an example of a method that we didn't have to define ourselves.

**for in loop
This is how we iterate over each key:value pair in an object.
for (let variable in objectname){}


**dot notation vs bracket notation
objectname.key => dot notation
objectname[key] => bracket notation
Both of these should access the same information (value associated w/key),
but the info in [] *must* be a string or number, or a var referring to objectname
in a for loop on an object, you must use bracket notation b/c using .key would 
literally look for the word "key" in the object, instead of whatever key is
currently holding in its variable.
