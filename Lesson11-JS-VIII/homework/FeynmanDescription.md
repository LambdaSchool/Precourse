The following are simple descriptions of relevant concepts.

1.) Recursion - Recursion is the unique ability for a function to call itself. This makes it possible to break down big, complex problems into smaller version of itself. For example, lets imagine that we have a rope where we just tied knot after knot until the whole rope was hopelessly tangled. If we had a function called untie knot, how could this function start to untie the rope? Our function could break down the large ball of knots into smaller and smaller knots until we reach what we call a base case, where we have the simplest type of knot, a granny knot. Our function could then untie the granny knot, and proceed outwards, untying all the granny knots that it finds. In this way, instead of tackling a large problem all at once, the problem is broken down into simpler pieces which are then broken down into smaller pieces, and so forth, until we have a simple enough case for our function to solve.
