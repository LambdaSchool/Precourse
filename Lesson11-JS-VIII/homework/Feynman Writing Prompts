* Recursion
    Recursion is when a function calls itself within the body of the function. It is a very helpful technique to do loops, it is effective when loops are not
    the best choice, like tree data structures and it's also important to remember that when we call the function within the parent function, we actually create
    a new function with different parameters, so we should make sure that this process ends at a point so we don't overflow the stack and we crash the computer
    or browser.
