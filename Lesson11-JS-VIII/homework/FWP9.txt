Recursion:  Recursion refers most often to the ability to call a function, from within itself, while performing a specific task on a piece of data.  Lets say you had a piece of data that you have to perform a specific action on, not just once, but several times, before it’s usable. You could do this with recursion, or recursively, within the function body, by writing the function to perform a specific action, or set of actions, on a piece of data, and then calling the function you are currently defining after you’ve done so, and passing it the piece of data you’re working on as an argument.
