Recursion

	Recursion is an alternative to iteration that is simpler to write, but is also more likely to result in an infinite loop if you make an error. It's basically a function that calls itself.

	I think this will become more important later as we try to learn how to balance elegant code vs. code that runs faster. Regular iterating loops run faster. Recursion looks prettier.
