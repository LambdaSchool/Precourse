	* Recursion

	Recursion refers to a function calling itself inside itself. Recursive functions are often
	used to traverse complex data structures like trees.

	You can think of recursion as another form of looping. For example given a simple for loop:

		for (let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
			console.log(i);
		}

	We can see that for loops in general have the following properties: an initializer(i = 0),
 	a condition to fulfill (i < 11), and an incrementor (i++) to move the loop to the next iteration.
 	Recursive functions also have these properties in common with for loops. 

 		function plusOne(num) {
 			if (num > 10) {
 				return;
 			}
 			console.log(num);
 			return plusOne(num + 1);
 		}

 		plusOne(1)

 	The recursive function plusOne also has an initializer in the form of its argument, num. It has a
 	condition in the boolean expression (num > 10) and a way of incrementing num.

 	When we invoke plusOne, it first checks to see if its condition is true. If num > 10 then the function
 	will stop running. Else num is logged to the console and plusOne calls itself with num + 1. 

 	All of these steps continue until num > 10.
