Recursion is another way to iterate through something instead of using a loop. They are used to simplify code but at the cost of efficiency. It has a base case to stop the code from executing any further just like a loop has a condition to stop the loop. The function invokes itself with the argument changing so that it reaches the base case and the results from the inner functions are given back to the outer function so that it can calculate the final result.

For example, if we have a line of people from left to right. The left most person ask the right neighbor to multiply 1 * 2 which equals 2 then the neighbor that was asked the question to his right neighbor to multiply 2 * 2 which equals 4 then it keeps going until we reach the right most person which is the base case. Then the result will go the opposite way until it reaches the original person who asked the question which says the final result.
