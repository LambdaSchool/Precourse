Recursion - Recursion is when a function calls on itself.  The function will call upon itself until a certain condition is reached.  It is similar to when we do a looping procedure.  The looping ends whenever a condition is reached.  For a function that uses recursion, this condition to be reached is called the base case.  Only when the base case becomes true will the recursive function calls end. It is important to know that when ever a function calls on itself, it also creats a new function scope which contains its own set of variables.  Each recursive function must have a return value which will be passed back up to the previous recursive function and so on until the initial function is reached.  Also, within each recursive function call , there must be an expression that moves toward the base case becoming true.
