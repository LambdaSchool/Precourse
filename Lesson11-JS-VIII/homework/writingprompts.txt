Recursion --
The ability to invoke a function within itself.
Recursion is a type of iteration similar to for and while loops. It can produce infinite loops if not careful.
It is usually easier and simpler to use recursive solutions, but for now it should be fine to use iterative code.
It is generally used when working with various data structures like trees, linked lists, or graphs.
Just another example of the flexibility of JavaScript and how programming has tradeoffs and different advantages for each purpose.
