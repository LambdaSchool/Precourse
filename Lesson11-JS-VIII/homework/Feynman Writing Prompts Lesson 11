Recursion - when you apply callbacks, where a function can be passed into another function, and also closure where a function can be inside another function, functions can do many things. one of those things is a function can call itself within iself, so like callbacks, you are passing a function into another function and activating it as you run the outermost function, but now, you are passsing in the function itself into itself, and like closure, the outermost functin can peek inside the innermost function. when this happens, the outermost function will call the inner function(itself), causing the innermopst function to change itself, but since they are the same function, it will change the outermost function, then the outermost function will run again, change the innermopst function, thus changing the outermost function, and this will keep happening over and over, causing a loop, this is what Recursion is. by the function calling itself within itself it causes the loop, similar to a reggular loop. and since it is similar to a regular loop, the function will call itself and change itself Infinitly unless you create a stop.
