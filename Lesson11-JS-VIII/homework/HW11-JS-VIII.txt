* Recursion - Recursion is the idea that a function can call(invoke) itself as an inner function.
The function has three parts like a 'for' and 'while' iterating function.  These are the counter(keeps track)
of the number of times it occurs), the base case or limit(function will stop when the limit is reached),
and the counter modification(move the counter toward the limit).
