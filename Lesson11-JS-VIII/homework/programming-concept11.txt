Recursion is when a function call itself inside of a itself.  What it does is that it breaks a problem into smaller subproblems.  One example is, lets say you want to add the sum of 5 all the way down to 1, you will usually do this 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.  In recursion you break that problem to subproblems like (5 + 4) = 9 and then (9 + 3) = 12 and then (12 + 2) = 14 and finally (14 + 1) = 15.
