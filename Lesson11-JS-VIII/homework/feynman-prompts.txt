* Recursion is a function which is self call from inside of its body. Its need to have a tracking variable and stop condition otherwise it will run endless. All recursion function can be implemented as for loop or while loop. E.g.
  `function myFunc(n) {
    // `n` is tracking variable
    if(n > 5) return; // Stop condision
    myFunc(n + 1); // Recursive call
  }`
