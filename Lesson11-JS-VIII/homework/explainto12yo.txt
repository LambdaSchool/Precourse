1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12
year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on slack.

-Recursion // Simply put is having a function invoke a function inside of itself. This will create layers of
functions so we must be carful when putting in the parameters or it will end up as an infinite loop. They can be
useful when replacing for and while loops but we must take special note because invoking a function inside of 
itself creates layers, they are not the same necessarily as other loops, where they can be thought of as creating
parrallels and not layers within themselves.
