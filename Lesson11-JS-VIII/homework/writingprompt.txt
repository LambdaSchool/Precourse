Recursion:

Now Recursion is by far one of the most powerful things I have found in
programming. Think of it like this; You can use a loop or you could use
recursion (really the same thing). The difference lays within how they are built.
Like so, let's say there is a road infront of you, and for the next 10 miles, 
every 5 meters, there is a small, but sharp ugly speed bump. You could drive 
over this with normal tires, basically using a loop in programming. OR you could
build specialty tires that have dents that excactly match the shape
of those wretched speed bumps, and these dents are perfectly spread out so 
that your drive for the next 10 miles is seemless, and smooth. 
And the reason this is very important to learn is because in programming, you
aren't going to have a choice, your going to be building a lot of specialty
tires.
