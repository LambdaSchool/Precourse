DOM: DOM is where you can get into some super fun stuff, more or less think of
'DOM' as 'DOM Manipulation' because what you are doing when using it is directly 
changing and manipulating the website. Meaning if you wanted to you could make
most, if not all of the pretty looking stuff on a website in only javascript.

DOM element selectors: Selecting elements and giving them a value in a script 
sounds really strange and complicated, but really all you do is use a selector
to grab an ID, class name or something similar and then make a shortcut for it
that you could name whatever you want. These are very helpful in programming 

DOM events: Events are a little more goofy than the past two. Because there is 
a whole lot you can do with them. Most of the time however your making buttons,
basic keyboard controls and pop ups ('alerts' if you want to be technical.)
Pretty much DOM is a very great and important thing to learn and understand in
javascript because it makes your job as a programmer much more simple when you
can access important document information all in one location, compared to a 
giant mess trying to do that same job without.
