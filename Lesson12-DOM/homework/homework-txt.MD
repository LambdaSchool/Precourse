1) The DOM is an abbreviation for the Document Object Model. The DOM represents a tree structure where each branch represents an object. We can manipulate this tree structure and change the content or add new content to it in many ways.

2) The DOM element selectors are the selectors that we use to select/create the elements from/to the DOM. We can access these elements through the DOM and change them or add new ones to it using built-in methods that exists in the document object model.

3) DOM events are used to notify the browser that certain actions are taking place. We can use events to notify the browser that a mouse click, hovering event and many other events are being executed.
