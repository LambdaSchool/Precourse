1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12
year old. Doing this will help you discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on slack.

DOM // Means document object model. It is the standard of how a document is accessed. It allows programs to
access and manipulate objects. It is a application programming interface. It allows programs to move around browsers.

DOM element selectors // Allows us to access different elements within the DOM. Examples can include class, div,
Ids, etc.

DOM events // You can setup an event in the DOM, where if an action is triggered another action will take place.
This allows for a more interactive experience for the user. A common event is the click, which is triggered when
the mouse button is clicked.
