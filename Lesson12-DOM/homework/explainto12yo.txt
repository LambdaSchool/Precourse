1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12
year old. Doing this will help you discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on slack.

DOM // Means document object model. It is pretty much the template for HTML. How it is structured and how it is
accessed and manipulated. It is a application programming interface. It allows programs to move around browsers.

DOM element selectors // Allows us to access different elements within the DOM. Examples can include class, div,
Ids, etc.

DOM events // You can setup and event in the DOM, where if an action is triggered another action will take place.
This allows for a more interactive experience for the user. A common event is the click, which is triggered when
the mouse button is clicked.
