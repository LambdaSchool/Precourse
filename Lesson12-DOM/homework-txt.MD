1) The DOM is abbreviated for Document Object Model. We can think of it as a logical tree structure starting from the root element which would be our <html> tag and going outwards through the <head>, <body> elements and every other element and text that lives inside of these elements. We use JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate, interact and modify contents within the DOM.

2) We use the DOM element selectors to interact with the DOM. These selectors provides us with a quick and easy way to retrieve elements from the DOM.

3) DOM events are functions that can be used when a user is clicking, mousing over or mousing out, dragging, resizing and doing many other things with the DOM elements.
