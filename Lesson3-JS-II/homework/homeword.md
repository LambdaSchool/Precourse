# Homework Lesson 3

#### for loop

A for loop is like going around a round-about. Just before entering the
round-about, we check if our initial conditions satisfy our exit conditions. If
they dont, we enter the round about and go around one time. When we get back to
the start, we add 1 to the initial condition, and check if we satisfy our exit
conditions. We keep going around and checking, until our current conditions
meet our exit conditions. then we stop the loop and keep driving down the road.

#### && || and !

&& means that all condition stated must be true for the expression to be true 
|| means that any one of the conditions must be true for the expression to be
true 
! means that whatever our expression evaluates to, its the opposite

#### Arrays

Arrays are like toilet paper. If you want an array of 5 names, you tear off
a strip of toilet paper 5 squares long, and write one name on each square. So
instead of 5 names in 5 different mailboxes( see Variables for last weeks
homework ) spread around the neibourhood, we have our strip of toilet paper all
conected and in one place
