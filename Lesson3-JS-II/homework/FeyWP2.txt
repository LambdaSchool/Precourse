for - Means that we are going to make a code repeat an action over and over again. 
        The variables will be changed each time the loop runs. And the loop will continue
        to run until we get the result we are seeking, or after a certain amount of times

&& || ! - These 3 symbols are logic operators. They allow us to evaluate 2 or more expressions
          at the same time, and tell us if they are true or not.
&& - This symbol will return TRUE if BOTH of the expressions are true. If only one of the expressions
      is true, then it will return false.
||  - this symbol means "or". It will return true even if only one of the expresions is true. But if 
      expressions are false, it will return false accordingly.
! - this symbol is called the NOT operator. It will produce the opposite of the boolean value it is called 
    upon.

Arrays - an array is like a jar full of data.We can fill this "jar" up with a limitless amount of strings
         booleans, or numbers. But each value must be seperated by a comma.
