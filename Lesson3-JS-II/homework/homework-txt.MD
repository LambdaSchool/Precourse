1) For loops are used to repeat conditions a certain known amount of times.

2) && is the and operator which is used to evaluate whether conditions are true or false. If one condition is false all conditions will evaluate to false. || is the or operator which is used to evaluate whether either one of a condition is true. If any of a condition is true in a || it will always evaluate to true even if there is false
statements mixed in the middle of it. ! is used to indicate the opposite of a condition. So !true is false and !false is true.

3) Arrays are lists that can store multiple values inside of them. We can assign arrays to variables which makes it easier for us to give a single variable multiple data types instead of assigning it a single item.
