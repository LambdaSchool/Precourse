# Homework #JSII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`
	* Arrays

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSII` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.

#### Congratulations on finishing Homework #2!

Okay, do the writing:

1. for:  okay, in this lesson we are using the keyword "for" to identify when we are starting a loop activity.  "for loop" have a specific 
structure so that you can add the right inputs and get the right output.  In general, following the word "for" we set the condition for the 
loop to run inside parenthesis.  Eg, for (this many) (as long as something is true), etc.  Then the {} curly braces indicate some function 
activity.  When the () condition is no longer true, the function/loop breaks out.

2. &&  this the symbol we use for the logic concept "and".  This means the things on either side of the && evalaute to true.

3. || this is the symbol for the logic concept "or".  This means one of the things on either side of the || is true.

4. ! this is the symbol for "not" and basically flips the logic on things...it's sort of the "opposite" symbol.

5.  Arrays:  I like the concept of arrays as bins to put things in.  The things can be numbers, strings, booleans - anything.  We put them 
in the array AND depending on the type of array we can use different methods on them.  

Off to do the example problems now...
