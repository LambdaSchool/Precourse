for
for-loops in javascript can be useful because instructions can be continuously performed while a certain condition remains true.
Dependent values can be changed by iterating an instruction so that the condition keeping the for-loop's boolean value, changes.
============================
&&, ||, !
&& will compare two conditions: one on the left and one on the right. The boolean value of the && expression is true if and only
if both conditions to each side are true. If either the expressions are false, the entire boolean value of the && expression
is false.

|| will compare two conditions: one on the left and one on the right. The boolean value of the || expression is true if either
of the conditions to each side are true. If none of the conditions to each side of the || expression is true, then the boolean
value of the expression is false.

! will take the boolean value of an expression and return the opposite. false becomes true, true becomes false.

Arrays
An array is a set of elements assigned to a variable. The elements can contain mixed data types. The order of the elements
within an array begins at 0.
