Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. 
Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

for: The for is used to evaluate a conditional expression. If a condition is true, it will run again, if it is false it 
     will stop running the code. For loops are mostly used to iterate over all of the items in a list or (array).

&&, ||, ! : These symbols are called logical operators. 
            && means AND. This operator will evaluate both expressions and will ONLY return true (boolean) if BOTH expressions are true.
            || means OR. This operator will determine if one of the expressions is true. It will return true if one (or both) of 
            the expressions is true. It will return false if BOTH expressions are false
            ! means NOT. This operator will return the opposite boolean value of what is passed to it.

Arrays: An array is a data contained in a group. It can be looked at like a list, collection, or inventory of items. Arrays can be accessed
        based on their position to the group or collection.
