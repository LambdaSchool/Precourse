Lesson 2 Homework
1. Variables: Variables are terms used to define a value that will be used in a program. Variables can use one of three keywords. Const means that the variable cannot be modified. Var and let variables can be modified.

Strings: Strings are collections of letters/numbers surrounded by quotes. Words must always be strings. Numbers may not.

Functions (arguments, return): A function tells a program what to do. Arguments are used within the function and are interchangeable, such as numbers used to compute an equation. A return is the output of the function and ends the function. 

if statements: An if statement tells the function what to do when certain conditions exist.

Boolean values: a Boolean is a binary value that can only be one of two choices (True or False).
