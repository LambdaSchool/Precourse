# Homework #JSII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`		     This creates a loop (a repetitive process). it can be used to repeat something a desired number of times or can be created with varaibles to run for variable lengths.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`    && makes it so only when both are true can an if statement's block be run, || lets the block be run so long as either or both are true, ! will make true/false statements inverse
	* Arrays	     These are used to store multiple data inputs (of any type but preferrably the same) 

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSII` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.

#### Congratulations on finishing Homework #2!
