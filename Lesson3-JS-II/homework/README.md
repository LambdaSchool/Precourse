# Homework #JSII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`: Used to create a loop, usually used to loop through an array or when you know how many times you need to loop.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`: Used when comparing two or more pieces of data to determine a Boolean value. && means "this AND this must be true to return true," || means "this OR this must be true to return true" and ! means "if this IS NOT true return true."
	* Arrays: Store multiple pieces of data in a specific order.

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSII` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
