for

The for statement is used to create a looping construct.  It allows you
to succinctly specify an initial value, a test for loop termination, and
an increment.  As an example:

    for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
        myArray[i] = i;
    }


&&, ||, !

These are logical operators.  && and || are binary operators (they act on 
two values) and ! is a unary operator (it acts on a single value).  && is
the logical AND operator, || is the OR operator, and ! is the NOT operator.
For example:

    true && false === false;
    true || false === true;
    !true === false;


Arrays

    An array is an object which contains an indexed list of items.  You can 
    access items in the array by using the square brackets with an index value,
    as follows:

    let ordinals = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth'];
    ordinals[0] === 'first';
