    for: For loops are used when you need to do something repeatly. We need to tell the function when to stop, so for loops are accompanied by a statement that defines the iteration. Otherwise, the program will keep looping over and over and never proceed to the next part.
	
	
    &&, ||, !: These are operators to use to set the conditions for a boolean check. Both conditions on either side of a && need to be true for the result to be true. || operator allows at least one condition to be true for the result to be true. ! can be thought of as "NOT". It allows you to reverse your boolean condition or your boolean result.
