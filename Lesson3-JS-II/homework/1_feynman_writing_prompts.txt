1. for
A for loop is used to execute a block of statements a set amount of times. It
has an integer value as counter, a limit on the counter for when the loop stops 
executing and a statement that manipulates the counter after every execution of
the loop. It may occur that the limit is never reached through manipulation of
the counter which results in an endless loop.


2. &&, ||, !
- && is a logical 'and'; if two values or statements are compared and both
evaluate to 'true', then the whole 'and' statement evaluates to true.
- || is a logical 'or'; if two values or statements are compared and one
of them evaluates to 'true', the the whole 'or' statement evaluates to true. In
order for an 'or' statement to be false, both compared values/statements have
to be false.
- ! is a logical 'not'; it's similar to a multiplication with -1; '!true' becomes
'false' and '!false' becomes 'true'


3. Arrays
Arrays are containers that can store more than one value (compared to variables).
They can store values of different types, so one array can hold integers and 
strings at the same time, for example. A specific value of an array can be
accessed by its value. If one wants to access the first element of an array, the
[0] index should be used. Arrays have specific functions to add or remove values
to them at different indices.
