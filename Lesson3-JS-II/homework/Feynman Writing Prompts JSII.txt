Feynman Writing Prompts

For
A for loop will run the same code multiple times each time with a different value, until a condition for that value
is met.

&&, ||, !
These are called logical operators. && means "and", it will evaluate two expressions and run true only if both of
the expressions are true. || means "or", it will evauluate two expressions and run true if either of the expressions
are true. ! means "not", it will evaluate an expression and return the opposite. So if an expression is false and
you put ! in front of it, it will run true. If an expression is true and you put ! in front of it, it will run false.

Arrays
An array is a variable with multiple value. It is essentially a storage container for data.
