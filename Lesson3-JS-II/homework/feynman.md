  * `for`
      for loops cycle through each item we want to examine, and figures out if what we are looking for is in there.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`
      && means that both things in question must be true in order for the entire thing to be true, otherwise it is false even if one of them is true.
      || means that only one of the things in question must be true
      ! means the opposite of whatever the ! is referencing. For example, !true would be false.
	* Arrays
      arrays are collections of things all grouped together with a single label to identify them as a group.
