for: It serves to iterate over numbers or elements of an array. This is constituted by three parts separated by 
semicolons. In the first the beginning of the iteration is fixed. In the second, the limit or the maximum amount
of the iteration is set. In the third part we say if the variable is added or subtracted.

&&: ItÂ´s the logical value and. Returns true if both expressions are true. If one or both expressions are false, 
it returns false.

||: It is the logical value or. Returns true if one or both expressions are true. If one or both expressions are 
false, it returns false. If the first expression is true, it will not evaluate the second expression.

!: It is the logical operator not. Deny the expression that continues. For example (!==) means it is not the same.

Arrays: An array is a set of data that are located consecutively. You can manipulate its elements, either by 
adding or removing data at the beginning or end, traversing them with a for cycle, etc.
