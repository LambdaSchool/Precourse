	* `for` - For is a type of loop in many programming languages. They can be implemented via for loops or for in loops. These types of loops are the kind where the programmer knows how many loops will run at the time of the program being written: for example, the length of an array.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` - These are conditional operators. && stands for and, || stands for inclusive or, and ! stands for not. 
	* Arrays - Arrays are sequential memory locations that often hold data of the same type. In Javascript arrays can hold data of differing data types, which isn't the case for all programming languages.
