For
-For loops are a way to iterate until conditions are met. Often used to go trough arrays. They are used to search through a series of something.

&&
- the '&&' represents and. A && B equates to A and B. 

||
-the '||' represent or. A || B equates to A or B.

!
- the '!' represents the opposite. != means not equal to.

Arrays
- Arrays contain sets of data. I believe the data are all the same type (numbers, strings, boolean, etc.)
