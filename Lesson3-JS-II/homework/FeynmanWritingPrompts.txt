A for statement is a looping statement that first initializes a value,
then checks a condition, and if true, then executes the body of theloop.
It then increments a value in the last statement, and then checks the 
loop condition again and loops until the condition is false.

&& - returns true when both comparisons are true, otherwise returns false.

|| - returns true when either of the comparisons and true, otherwise returns false.

!  - flips true to false and false to true based on the value of the operand

An array is a sequence of different data indexed and grouped together.
