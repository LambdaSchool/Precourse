'for' - 'for' is used to begin a loop in code. This loop is usually used to iterate over a set of values
starting when certain conditions are met. Normally a block of code is executed for each value until
the given conditions are no longer met.

'&&' - The && (and) operator is what is called a logical operator. Logical operators are used to see if a 
value meets certain conditions. The && operator specifically, is used to compare a value against 
multiple conditions and all of the conditions must be met (evaluate to 'true') in order for the
proceeding code to be executed. Otherwise it evaluates to 'false'.

'||' - The || (or) operator is another logical operator. Like the && operator it is used to see if a given
value meets multiple conditions. Unlike the && operator if only one of the conditions is met the expression
evaluates to 'true' and the following block of code is executed. If none of the conditions are met the expression
evaluates to 'false'.

'!' - The '!' (not) operator reverses the value returned from evaluating an expression.

Arrays - An array is another data type like strings, numbers, and booleans. Arrays are sort of like
a container that holds a collection of data. Normally it is considered good practice to store the
same data types in an array but they can consist of multiple data types.
