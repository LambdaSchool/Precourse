For:

You may want to have a sequence of instructions executed multiple times; you can
use a for loop for that. In the simplest form, the for construction gives you a
counter to keep track of how many times you've executed the sequence, and stops
when the counter reaches some predetermined number.

You could also do more tricky things like start with the counter at some
positive number and count down each time you go through the sequence, and stop
when you reach some lower bound.

&& || !

These perform logical operations on what is input. && takes two truth values and
returns true if both inputs are true, false otherwise; || takes two values and
returns false if both values are false, and true otherwise; ! returns true if it
gets false and returns false if it gets true.

Arrays

Arrays in this language are lists of values. The values don't have to be of the
same type.
