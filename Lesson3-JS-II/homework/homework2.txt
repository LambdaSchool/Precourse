Feynman writing prompts:

for: For is a sort of code word (syntax) for a set of instructions we set to repeat over and over again until we instruct it not to.

&&: In place of writing out the word 'and' in code, we write &&.

||: In place of writing out the word 'or' in code, we write ||.

!: To make something the opposite of what it is in code, we use an exclamation mark. So if something is true, and we put an exclamation mark before it, it's false.

Arrays: An array is somewhat like a shelf of items at a grocery store. On the shelf there's a pear, orange, and banana. That's what an array is; a collection of items.
