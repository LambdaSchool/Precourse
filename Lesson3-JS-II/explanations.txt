1. The for keyword is used to start a loop (something you do over and over). After that you declare a counter variable.
    The loop will use the counter to start the loop and then use a condition based on that counter to know when to stop the loop.
    The last part of the for statement is when you change the counter so it eventually reaches the stop condition.
    
2. && is the logical and. Both sides must be true or the whole thing is false. E.g. The sky is blue && The sun rotates around
    the Earth. Only one of those things is true so the whole thing is false. With || (a.k.a. the logical or), only one of those
    things has to be true for the whole thing to be true, which means the previous statement would be true. ! (a.k.a. logical not)
    takes what is false and makes it true and vice versa. So if I say !(1 > 2) then I would get true since 1 > 2 is false but when
    you apply the ! operator, it becomes true.
    
3. Arrays are a collection of values stored next to each other in memory. Let's say you wanted to store your friends for use in
    a program. You could write let friend1 = "Max", friend2 = "Sue", friend3 = "Sam" etc. but this would get tedious and clutter
    up your code. A much easier way is to have one variable store all your friends in an array like this:
    let friends = ["Max", "Sue", "Sam"]
