#for
for indicates that you want to run something a certain amount of times, and get the results.

#&&
This is something you would use when you want it to resolve true if statements on the left and the right are both true.

#||
This is something you would use to indicate you want only 1 side of the statements to be true for it to resolve as true. 

#!
This simply flips the logic. True to false, false to true. 

#Arrays
Arrays are a matrix of numbers that you wish to store and access to run other things against.
