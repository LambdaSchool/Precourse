 Variables are used by programmers to identify values in a code.
 Strings are characters that the programmer wants the variable to display when code is ran. They must have single or double quotes around them. 
 Functions are commands that are created by the programmer to compute or change the variable. Arguments within the function are like values and return is used to execute the argument.
 If statements execute certain functions if the argument is true.
 Boolean values are the core of the computer language and stand for true or false when used in Javascript.
