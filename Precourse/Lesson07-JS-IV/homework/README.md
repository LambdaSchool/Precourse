# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - not ordered and labeled
	* Properties - Keys of an object that show a specific value
	* Methods - perform a function
	* for in loop - cycle through objects without knowing the keys/properties of it
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation - Dot is used when you know the property of an object that you can access with the bracket.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
