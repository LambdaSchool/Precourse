While an array usually a ordered or an unordered list of items that are usually in the same category, an object contains items that are not neccessarily the same, but apply to something collectivly. For example, the names of several clients can be in an array. The name, address, email, and phone number for one client can be in an object. An array and object can be modified in similiar, but slightly different in set up, ways. 

	* Properties - Properties are information about the object. For example, for object cat the property would be fuzzy. 
	* Methods - Methods are actions that can be used on objects. A method is considered a property with a function inside. They can be used to call information in the object, or modify the object. 
	* for in loop - For in loop loops through the properties of an object repeatedly until a spefic criteria is met. 
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation - Braket notation is used with arrays. Although some bracket notation can still be used with objects, mostly dot notation is used. They look as they are named.
