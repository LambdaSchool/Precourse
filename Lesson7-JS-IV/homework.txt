Objects
--Objects are like arrays in that they have a collection of data. Unlike arrays, this data is about one thing. 

Properties
--Properties are characteristics that are associated with the object we are identifying. They are KEY to finding 
out information about our object.

Methods
--Methods are basically functions (blocks of code that execute a statement or statements) that are used 
as a property in an object. 

for in loop
-- the for in loop is a type of loop that can be used when going over each key:value pair in an object. This
is used when we don't have numerical indices (like we do in arrays)

Dot notation vs bracket notation
--Dot notation allows us to recall or assign new values to keys. The syntax is as follows:

Object.KeyIdentification;

Bracket notation is very similar to dot notation but uses brackets instead. The only difference is that 
we must use strings or numbers to ID the key that has to be wrapped in quotes. The syntax is as follows:

Object['KeyIdentification'];

That being said, we can use a variable that points to the property that is in quotes. If the KeyIdentification
in brackets is a variable, quotes are not necessary.
