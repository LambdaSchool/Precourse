==> Objects: 
    Are a collection of properties. Properties Are
    associations between keys and values. A name can be a 
    referred to as a key. the value of the properties can be
    a function and when a function is used as the value of the 
    property then it is called a method.

==> Properties: 
    Are attributes of objects and they define the characteristics of that 
    object and to change the characteristics you just change the values 
    of it's properties.

==> Methods:
    Are actions that can be performed on objects and are properties with 
    a fuction definition.

==> for in loop: 
    Is a statement looping through properties of an object, basically going 
    through all the properties seeing if the condition set is present 
    and is executed for each property.

==> Dot notation vs bracket notation:
    Dot notation is faster to write and clearer to read.
    
    Square bracket notation allows accessto properties containing special 
    characters and selection of properties using variables.
