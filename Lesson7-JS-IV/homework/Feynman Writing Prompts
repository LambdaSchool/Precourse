Feynman Writing Prompts Lesson7

Objects:
Objects, like arrays, are data structures; containers for information that an engineer may need to
access, add-to, count, or otherwise manipulate. Within objects the information is stored
in 'key:value' pairs and the items are 'somewhat' related, but in arrays the information contained
therein is organized with 'zero' referencing and the items are more closely related. Each item
is assigned a number by which it is referenced when manipulated by an engineer, starting with the
first item assigned to zero. The items in objects are not referenced by numbers unless an engineer
uses 'key:value' pairs to assigned the numbers.

Properties:
In objects, information is organized by 'key:value' pairs. The word 'properties' is interchangeable
with the word 'key' in 'key:value'. Each property has a value, which is called upon by the key.

Methods:
Functions that are contained within objects as 'key:value' pairs are referred to as methods. They
give the software engineer a way to access and manipulate the information therein.
