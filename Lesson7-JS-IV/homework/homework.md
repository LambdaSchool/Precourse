##Objects
    Objects contain keys, or properties, that have values. Objects are also iterable, and can contain their own methods that act on the object itself.
##Properties
    Properties are the keys of objects, and are what's accessed from the outside.
##Methods
    Methods are functions defined inside objects that act on the properties of objects.
##for in loop
    A loop that iterates through the object, similar to a for loop for arrays.
##Dot notation vs bracket notation
    Dot notation is one way of accessing properties in an object, i.e. object.property. Bracket notation is similar, but can pass variables as the property for more flexibility, like object[variable].
