- Objects = Objects in JavaScript are objects that contain a list of comma delimited key-value pairs, which are comprised of keys and values associated with each other by a `:`. They are like Arrays, but do not have an index numbering  their items. They are defined by a name followed by the curly brackets `{}` instead of the straight brackets `[]` like Arrays. Objects can contain all types of JavaScript data, including functions, which when defined inside of an object is called a method.
- Properties = Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is made up of a list of these properties.
- Methods = Methods are functions stored as properties within an Object. Methods can also be used for String, Array, Number, Date or DOM objects, which differ than Methods used inside of Objects.
- for in loop = The for in loop is a looping function that cycles through the properties of a JavaScript Object.
- Dot notation vs bracket notation = Dot notation and bracket notation are ways of accessing or manipulating data in a Javascript object. Dot notation uses the period `.` between the object or key and the method or value pair, while bracket notation uses straight brackets `[]` with a pair of apostrophes `''` enclosing the method or value pair. Either can use variables, but bracket notation does not require the apostrophes for variables.
