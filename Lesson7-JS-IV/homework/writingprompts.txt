Objects: objects are variables that can contain many values. For example, a person could be an object, it will have the property of first name
and its value will be that person's first name.

Properties: properties are the pairs of name and values. Everything comes with a property of its own, be it something that makes it recognizable
or something that decribes that object.

Methods: Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Like a person can walk, talk, or jump. Those are all methods given to a person.

For in loops: for in statements loops through properties of an object. 

Dot notation vs breacket notation: There's not much difference between a dot and bracket notation, though a dot notation is easier to read. 
Bracket notations are mostly used when working with arrays.
