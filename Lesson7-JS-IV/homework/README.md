# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - a collection of properties. These properties are specific to the object and can also be functions
	* Properties - the elements of an object. when an object that has a 'name' property, that name property can be accessed. It's essentially a variable that exists for and only for it's specific object
	* Methods - just what functions are when they belong to an object
	* for in loop - like a for loop, but cycles through properties in an object. It will cycle through all of the properties and stop when it gets to the end.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation - dot notation is the most common and can be used to access properties. The differences are subtle but important. dot notation cannot use spaces or numbers at the beginning of the property name. Bracket notation MUST be used in string format but can use spaces to access the properties.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
