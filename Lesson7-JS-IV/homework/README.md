# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects = Objects are variables that can hold pieces of data we can access later. They can also hold special set of instructions to do specific things.
	* Properties = Properties are the keys inside the object naming the different information you got inside the object.
	* Methods = They are essentially functions inside the object that can be called using the object
	* for in loop = it's a nice way of iterating through each key of an object to get or modify each piece.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation = essentially they are the same only that when using bracket notation it got to be a string. For me it would be a matter of preference unless a string you have can call a property inside the object.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
