# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Objects: container for multiple values(method, properties)
	* Properties: assigned name and value (firstName : Bob; age: 20;)
	* Methods: tasks object should perform
	* for in loop: statement that loops through properties and excutes each property within object
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation: dot identifies a property (cannot use variables); identifies property by string or variable ('cat').

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
