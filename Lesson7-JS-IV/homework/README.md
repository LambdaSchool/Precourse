# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	* Properties
	* Methods
	* for in loop
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation

An object is, like an object in real life, something that holds multiple pieces of information and functions about it. An example of an "object" in real life that can be compared to this is a chicken. A chicken's dna holds information about the chicken which makes the chicken what it is, called properties. Information like eyeColor: yellow, wings: 2, beak: pointy, alive: true, which is how it is written in an object in Javascript. Objects can also hold other things such as arrays, functions and even other objects. A function that is within an object is called a method. An example of a method within a chicken is an action it performs,such as eating, or squaking. We can call upon the chicken object to perform the eat method when we present it with food, as it is programmed to do.

A for in loop looks at a group of objects, either being an array or an object with several properties, and it performs an action on each one of the properties within that group.

Dot notiation and bracket notation are just two different systems for writing the same thing, much like script vs cursive. below I will write out two different ways you can make the chicken object make a noise using the different types of notation.
let sound = obj.chicken; //THIS IS DOT NOTATION
let sound = obj['chicken']; //THIS IS BRACKET NOTATION


2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
