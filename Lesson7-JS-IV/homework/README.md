# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - is a collection of methods(functions) and properties(key/value pair)
	* Properties - a data that relates ot the object
	* Methods - does an action/function
	* for in loop - in contrast to a classic for loop, this loop makes it easier to work with an array
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation - Both of them allow access properties on an object; however, bracket notation allows to pass in a variable.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
