1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
		Objects are created by using braces {} and are a container of data. The data are called properties which is specified by a name or key and a value.

	* Properties
		Properties are the values specified in an object. To specify the different values, we follow the syntax "key: value". Key is the name of the property and value is the value of the property. Values can be string, number, boolean, array, function or even another object.  

	* Methods
		Methods are functions which are set as a property's value of an object.  

	* for in loop
		We use the for in loop to iterate over each key:value pair in an object. In other words, it loops through the properties of an object. We cannot use the standard loop because objects do not have indexes unlike arrays.   		

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
		There are two ways to access the values of an object. We use dot notation by calling the object name, a dot, then the key. 

		With bracket notation, we call the name of the object and then the key which is wrapped in brackets.
