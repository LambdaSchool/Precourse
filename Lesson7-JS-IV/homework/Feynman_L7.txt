* Objects
	* Properties
	* Methods
	* for in loop
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation


Feynman says ;)

Objects are important in Javascript. They provide a means of grouping data together with labels. This is also known as key:value pairs. An example would be like

email: hello@email.com...

We call this keys:value pairs in objects Properties. If the value is a function, then this special case is referred to as a Method.

As the characteristics of an object is the key:value pairs, we have use a for loop which takes advantage of this... The syntax is

for (let key in object){
    statements...
} 

We can refer to the values contained in an object in 3 ways. 

Using bracket notation

Way 1
object['propertyname']

and 

Way 2
object[variable] (This is useful as it allows us flexibility and power of the concept of variables and are not hardcoding the name)

Using dotnotation

Way 3
This is the preferred compared to Way 1.
object.propertyname (notice that no quotes are needed)
