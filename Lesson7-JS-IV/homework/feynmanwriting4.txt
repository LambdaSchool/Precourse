objects are similar to arrays ,but the data is stored in key:value format. For example consider an object describing a triangle. Attributes of triangle are the keys and each triangle is unique and has unique values assigned to the keys.

Keys of a triangle can be it's area, length of each side, each angle, etc.
Const triangle = {
area:'25';side1:' 7cm';angle1:'45';}
;

properties and attributes are the same. They are similar to variables.
Methods- functions can be created within an object, these functions are known as methods.

For in loop
Dot notation versus bracket notation
Data stored in an array can be manipulated by using a for loop. This cannot be done for the data stored in an object.
For in loop is used for this purpose.

Once we have key:value pairs we can access those values by calling the object name and the key. There are two different ways to do this, dot notation and bracket notation.

With dot notation we can just call the object name, a dot, and the key name. Just as we call the .length property on an array (hint: the length property is a key:value pair):
