1) An object is similar to a dictionary. They have keys that show what we want to describe and a value assigned to a particular key that defines the key. Objects can hold as many key/value pairs that we want it to contain inside an object they just need to separated by a comma. The key is always a word that describes what we will attach to it as a value. Values can be any JavaScript type. For example, we can create a car object that has key names set to make, model, year, origin, allWheelDrive. We would set the values to "Audi", "A6", 2013, "Germany", true.

2) Properties are the keys/value pairs combined together. It's what makes a connection between a key and a value pair.

3) Methods are functions inside of objects. We can take a method and perform a action with it in our object and make the object perform a certain task or calculate a value we want it to do for us with a particular method inside.

4) A for in loop is used to loop through properties in a object.

5) We use dot notation or bracket notation to get access or assign a value to a property in a object.
