1) Objects are similar to arrays, but instead of having only strings in a list we have key pairs that has values defined to them. We can think of objects as dictionaries where the key is a word and the value a definition of that word.

2) Properties are the keys and values inside of an object. Properties are what make a connection between a key and a value pair.

3) Methods are functions inside of objects. We can take these methods and perform actions with them on our object to make the object perform a certain task.

4) We use the for in loop to loop through the properties of an object.

5) We use dot notation or bracket notation to get access or assign values to properties in a object.
