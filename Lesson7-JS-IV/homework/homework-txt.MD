1) We can think of objects like dictionaries. They have a key that identifies what we want to describe and a value that defines the key.

2) Properties are the keys and values combines together inside of an object. It's what makes a connection between a key and a value pair.

3) Methods are functions inside of objects. We can take a method and perform a action with it in our object and make the object perform a certain task or calculate a value we want it to do for us with a particular method.

4) For in loops are used to loop through the properties in a object.

5) We use dot notation or bracket notation to gain access or assign values to properties in a object.
