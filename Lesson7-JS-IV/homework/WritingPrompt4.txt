Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects

		In JavaScript, objects are a group of key value pairs. Each key is unique to
		a value in an object. Values can be primitives, arrays, other objects, and even functions. Unlike arrays, objects are unordered so they do not use
		indexes. In order to access value, you need to first access the value's key. 
		For example, in order to access a word's definition you need to find the word in a
		dictionary. Objects can hold as many key value pairs as a developer needs.

	* Properties

		Properties, also known as keys, are links to values in objects which can hold
		many properties at once. All properties are strings in JavaScript.

	* Methods

		Methods are functions that are associated with object properties. These
		functions are anonymous because they are not named like functions
		stored in variables. Instead methods are associated with unique keys. Calling
		a method requires you to access its key in the object and use ().

	* for in loop

		A for in loop is a way of iterating through all the keys in an object. This type
		of loop is similar to a for loop on an array but is only used for objects since it does not guarantee any sort of order. For in loops allow you to access and modify object
		key value pairs.

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation

		Dot notation is the default method of accessing object key value pairs. It is
		used when you already know the properties in an object and when the properties
		are not variables.

		Bracket notation is used when you don't know the keys in an object or when you
		are given a variable associated with a value in an object.
