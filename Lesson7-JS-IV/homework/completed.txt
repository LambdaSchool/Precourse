* Objects --- have many properties that can be changed when desired.

* Properties --- the relationship between a name in an object and its value.

* Methods --- actions that you can do to an object.

* for in loop --- like a for loop, except it goes through each property in the object

* Dot notation vs bracket notation --- Bracket notation is a bit more helpful in for/in loops, but both are effective 
means of accessing keys in objects.
