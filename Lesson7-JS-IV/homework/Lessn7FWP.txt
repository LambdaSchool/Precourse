	* Objects:
    An object is very similar to an array. It is like a jar that can hold different types of values.
    It's different from an array because an array can only hold one value type (a string, number, or boolean), whereas
    an object can hold all 3 if need be. Everything in JavaScript is an object. And objects can be put inside of arrays.

	* Properties:
    Properties are also known as key value pairs. These are what go inside of your
    objects. You always want to put a trailing comma at the end of your value pairs.
	
    * Methods: 
    A method is a function that is perform on an object. You can use mathmatical methods or string methods. A method must
    be called upon using dot notation. Methods are essentially shorthand for functions assigned to a methods name. The
    object name is the first part. Then it is followed by a " . " and then the method name.
