Objects
Objects hold information about one thing, not multiple. They have key:value pairs.
Object key:value pairs are an object(value) about one thing with a certain key word that calls it.
Objects are separated by commas not semicolons.
Methods
Methods are functions saved on an object. (.length, .push, .pop) They work just like functions.
For...In Loops
For...In Loops are the same as for loops with some different syntax. Use the in keyword.
This
This is a self referential keyword used in an object. Very useful in methods.
Dot Notation
Dot Notation is a way of calling an objecting using a (.).
Bracket Notation
Bracket Notation is the most common way of referencing an object.
Bracket Notation uses ({}) and inside must be a string ('', "").
