Feynman Writing Prompt - Lesson 7

Objects - A collection of data that is stored as a group in memory.

Properties - Sort of like a feature of some thing...like age of a person.

Methods - This is a function within an object.

for in loop - Special loop that works with objects.

Dot notation vs bracket notation - Dot notation is used when you know the name of a property (key)--working directly with it.
Bracket notation is used when the property (key) has spaces in it or when the property has been assigned to a variable.
