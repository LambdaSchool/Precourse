Objects are another different type of data structure that is used in JavaScript. An object is different from
an array in that it is a more organized manner in which to store different kinds of data. You can assign
specific data in an object with names that will allow you to access specific data by using the specific
tag that you used.

The tags you use for the data that is stored are called Properties and you can consider them as properties
of the object. Examples of properties are "color", "size", "location"..etc.

Methods work in the same way as a function does but it works only specifically for that object. The object
can have a unique set of methods you want it to allow it to perform.

Since a for loop using an i variable couldnt work for an object as it does with an array, we use a different
method to go through the different data of an object. This method is called a for in loop that is accessed
by using the inherent "key" value of an object. You can loop through all the property key values you gave 
to an object and it the data you assigned to each property.

Dot notation and bracket notation are two different ways to access the property of an object. Using the 
bracket notation works similiar to an array in that you put the information you seek in between brackets
next to the object such as, object['specificProperty'] or object[specificVariable]. Dot notation
works in a different manner in that you don't use quotations and look up the property straight up with the
syntax of (object).(property). Ex. object.specificProperty. Bracket notation can use variables from
arguments where as dot notation cannot.
