Feynman Writing Prompts:
1. Objects -- Objects are like Arrays and Variables in that they are like boxes that can store multiple data.
2. Properties -- These are simply the keys to objects.
3. Methods -- These are functions that are contained within objects.
4. For In Loop -- This is another type of For Loop that only works in objects
5. Dot Notation vs Bracket Notation -- These are the two ways of assigning values when creating objects.
