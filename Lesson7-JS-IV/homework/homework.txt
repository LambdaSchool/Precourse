Almost everything in java script is an object. Objects can be filled with so called keys that are paired with a value! For example you can have the key "name" and pair it with your name.

Properties - or so called keys - are the first part of an entry in an object. Often it gives context to the value. 

Methods are little "programs" within objects. In this case the key is the name of the program and the value dictates what the "program" does.

A for in loop goes through an object key by key.

Square bracket notation should always be used if a) the key name has a space or hyphen in it OR starts with a number or b) if the property name is determined dynamically (for example passed into a function)
