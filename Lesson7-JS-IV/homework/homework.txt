Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Objects

Objects are similar with arrays, both can store information but arrays is a collection of related items and objects are for the same thing.

Properties

Since a object identifies one thing, we can describe them with properties.

Methods

Methods are like functions but the are related to the object.

for in loop

The for in loop is similar with the regular for, but can't be uses with objects. Objects must use for in loop.

Dot notation vs bracket notation

Both are used to access the properties in a object but sometimes is necesary to use bracket when we use a variable and can be a string or number.

Notation is only to access with the property name.
