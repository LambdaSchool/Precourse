Objects are like variables but can do a lot more because they can hold any number of arrays, functions, or 
variable types which go by properties

information stored inside an object is called property(ies)
properties can be accessed with dot notation ex. object.property

methods are functions inside an object, you can do a lot with the ability to call on objects with functions
 inside of them

For in loop is a way to search for a value inside of an array or object without having to type out super long code

dot and bracket notation is basically . vs []
you use both to call on different things, dot notations is used to call properties within a function 
bracket notation is used to call object properties as well
