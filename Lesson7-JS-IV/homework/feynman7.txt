1. What are objects in JavaScript?

    Objects in Javascript hold information like arrays, but instead of holding several different things, 
    objects store different information about one thing (for example, a website user).

2. What are properties?

    Properties are the values held inside of an object.

3. What are methods? 

    Methods are functions inside of an object.

4. What is a 'for in' loop?

    A 'for in' loop is a way to iterate over an object, because it does not have numerical indices the 
    way an array does.

5. What are the differences between dot notation and bracket notation?

    Dot and bracket notation are two different ways to access properties within an object. With dot 
    notation, the name of the property would be written after the dot. Bracket notation is more similar 
    to how items are accessed within an array, but with bracket notation, a string or number must be in 
    between the brackets.
