1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	* Properties
	* Methods
	* for in loop
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
	
	Objects: 
	Objects let you store multiple pieces of data in one place. There are several things that are true about you as a person - you have a name, and an age, and probably a favorite food. Objects let you store all of those pieces of data in one place in a way that makes more sense than a list would. You can store that data in an object using key: value pairs like name: 'Anna', age: 12, food: 'Mac and Cheese'
	
	Properties: 
	The key: value pairs in objects are known as properties. 
	
	Methods: 
	Methods are functions that exist inside of an object. 
	
	for in loop: 
	a for in loop will loop through your object and the code block will be executed once on each property. 
	
	Dot notation vs bracket notation: 
	You can access properties in an object with either dot or bracket notation. Dot notation is nameOfObject.nameOfProperty and bracket notation is nameOfObject[nameOfProperty] If you're using a variable to look for something in the properties, you need to use bracket notation (but this will only work if your variable resolves to a string!)
