* `prototype`
    The prototype for a class is created when we write the class and this is the place where we put all the functions that are common among the instances of 
    an object. This is used so that we don't occupy extra memory by creating copies of common functionality among the instances of an object.

* Constructors
    Constructors are functions that we call when we create a new instance of an object, and where we can initialize the properties of the instance. We create the 
    instance using the word 'new' before we call the constructor, which resembles a common JavaScript function with parameters that we pass to the constructor to
    initialize its properties.
