* Constructors: are functions that create objects for us based on a template-object extracted from the properties arguments  of that function. Using  that template we could create as many objects as we need and without occupying a big storage space in the memory. We just use  the word 'new' and we pass new arguments to  obtain new object with that arguments.

* prototype : it is a way to  add and share the methods with all the users of that code or program that created by the constructor object. Prototypes are functions that do actions in the code and are accessed by all the classes or the instances of that classes created by the constructor class-function . Let say we have 100 users of the application, all the 100 users have access to one method or multiple method contained in that app. Creating the prototype methods allow us to save memory and share the same methods among any number of users.
