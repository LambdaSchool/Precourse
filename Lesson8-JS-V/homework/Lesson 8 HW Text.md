This may not seem like a big deal, to take up one or two more lines of space, but it can add up quickly when you have thousands of entries, like usernames for a website. 

	* Constructors - Constructor is a template for objects created within a class. It states what each object in the class will contain. For example, in the constructor for the class called Cats, you can include fur color, eye color, name, and favorite toy. These will be listed for every new cat (object) you add to the class Cats.
