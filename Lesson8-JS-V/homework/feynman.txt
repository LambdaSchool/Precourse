Prototypes in the javascript language is a manner in which you can apply new methods to an object without
having to individually assign it to every object of the same type. The prototype is a lot more memory
efficient in that it only applys it as an attachment. This coincides with the functionality of the class
structure. 

The class is basically a template of an object that you can use to build similar objects with
the same properties without having to create a new object for each one individually. The prototype works
in the same manner that all objects of the same class will be receive the method or property from the
prototype assignment. The prototype will default to any original assignment in the class function and will
act as a backup of sorts.
