	* `prototype`
The prototype is the things everything of a certain type shares.  For example in the real world, all cars have steering wheels. It's part of the prototype for 'car.' But they aren't all green, and they aren't all made by Ford.  Those are variable from one car to the next.  We often use the prototype of a class to store functions, which are things we want to do with the data in every individual member of the class.  For example, strings come with methods on the prototype which let us change them to upper or lower case. Regardless of the specific characters in a string, we can use the methods on the prototype with the string.
	* Constructors
Constructors are functions which make a new type of thing we can use over and over. We capitalize their first character to differentiate them from other functions and variables.  The new type of thing is called a class.  We might make a car constructor for example.  If we were classifying things in the real world in this way, the car constructor would specify that every car will have a color, manufacturer and default radio station.  We might also but abilities we want every car to have, such as the ability to drive.  These would be the things in the "prototype" for car. Constructors in Javascript work the same way.  We might have a constructor called makeNewUser which takes in values for a user's name, age and password. These would differ among the different users.  But makeNewUser would also have a prototype with functions we can call on all users, such as a "say hi" function to print "hi from {user's name}".
