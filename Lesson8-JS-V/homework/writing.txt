Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts 
like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you 
quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

us to build methods outside of the class object. This gives every object of that
class access to those methods.


Constructors/Class - Classes share much of the functionality as an object. The difference
is that classes allows you to create many objects that share some of the same
properties and methods.
