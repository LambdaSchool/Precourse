1. What is a prototype?

    A prototype (in Javascript) is a property of a class that allows a method to be set once (instead 
    of having to store it in multiple class instances). This uses significantly less memory than it 
    would if a method were set in every class.

2. What are constructors?

    A constructor is a method that creates an object within a class.
