	* `prototype`
	* Constructors
	
	prototype: 
	Objects in javascript inherit properties from a prototype. All of them do, even though you don't see them beyond the ones that you create when you're looking at your code. There's a chain of inheritance. You can use the prototype property to add methods to already-created constructors. 
	
	Constructors: 
	A constructor is what you use to build (or construct!) an object. If you want to add properties or methods to it later, you need to add them in the constructor function.
