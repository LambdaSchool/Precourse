prototype - technically every object has a prototype. prototypes allow objects to inherit their methods and properties. when it comes to objects and classes, you can add methods outside of the objects/classes themselves by using their prototypes to add the methods/properties inside the prototype instead of the objects/classes themselves. this will allow you to save memory, for example, if you have a User class template, and it is associated with thousands of users, if you have a method inside the class, if will repeat that method for EACH user, Instead of only using it when needed. By putting it inside the classes's prototype instead, it will allow you to create one method that can be used for each of the user.



Constructors - another data type is something called classes, classes are used if you have many objects you need to write. for example if you have 100 users, that you need to write info on(name, email, password). Instead of writing 100 different objects, you can simply write a class and add all of the users to that class. The way you add the users into the class is you first create a template with what you will put for each user(like email, name, password, etc). the Constructor is what the template is, it is the template where you will choose what keys each new object you create will have. The way you do that is by creating the class, similar to a function, you are going to put the placeholders to act as keys, and inside it, you are going to link the keys with the placeholders using a special keyword 'this'.
