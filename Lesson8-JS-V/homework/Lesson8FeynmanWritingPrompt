'prototype' - A prototype is a property that is included in every class. The prototype lets the user set a method and gives every object in the class access to the method.

Constructors - Also called 'class', constructors are used to create many objects that share the same properties and methods. Constructors use the '.this' to assign properties and methods.
               By setting a variable using the 'new' keyword, users can create many objects without having to type their code separately.
               Ex: function Car(name) {this.name = name;} const ford = new Car('Ford');
