1) A prototype is a way of setting a method once and giving every object of that class access to the method. Making things simpler and not having to create thousands of class objects. We can also add new properties with prototypes to a existing object.

2) Constructors or classes are special methods that allow us to create objects multiple times that share the same properties and methods without having to repeat ourselves multiple times.
