1) A prototype is a way of setting a method once and giving every object of that class access to the method. Making things simpler and not having to create thousands of class objects. We can also add new properties with prototypes to a existing object.

2) Constructors are special methods for creating and initializing an object that makes it easier to create multiple objects with the same properties and methods without having to keep repeating ourselves.
