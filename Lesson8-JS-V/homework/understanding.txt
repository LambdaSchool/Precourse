==> Prototype:
    Is how Javascript objects inherit features one from another.
    this is why Javascript is often referred to as a prototype-based
    language. Each object has a prototype object that acts as a template
    that can inherit methods and properties from each other, so on and so on. 
    this is called prototype chain.

==> Constructors:
    Constructors are properties of objects. Objects created without the explicit
    use of a constructor function WILL have a constructor property that points 
    to the object constructor type for that object.
