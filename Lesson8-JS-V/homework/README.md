# Homework #JSV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `prototype` - The "top level" of each class. Every class has a prototype and therefore has "hidden" methods associated with it. For example, if I create an array called "myArray", it is an array class and has access to the prototype methods within that array class. I could call myArray.toString() and it would invoke the toString() method. I could also call .length() or any of the other array prototype class methods.
	* Constructors - The "building zone" of a class. It allows for us to "construct' classess with different values without actually hardcoding every one of those values or classes. A constructor might assign a name or password to an 'User' class, or a name and age to a 'Cat' class. 

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
