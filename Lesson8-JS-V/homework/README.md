# Homework #JSV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `prototype` = prototypes are a way to consume less memory space and create methods that can be used by various objects when needed.
	* Constructors = a template we can use to initialize an object with predefined conditions set before. This makes it easier when coding instead of writing the same thing we can use a contructor.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
