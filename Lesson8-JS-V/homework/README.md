# Homework #JSV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* `prototype`: lets you add new methods and properties to object types that exist (object.prototype.name = value)
	* Constructors: method that creates and puts a value to object that is within a class. (constructor([arguments]) { ... })

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSV` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
