Prototypes are just properties and methods of a constructor function.  Lets say there is a person object that has name and age properties.  If you created the person from a constructor and the constructor function has a greet prototype method that say "Hello", inherit that prototype method or you can just override it and say "Hi", because you perfer to say "Hi" instead of "Hello".  The default of the greet method will be "Hello".

Constructor functions are like factories that can build objects.  Lets say you go to a Honda factory, the factory is the constructor and the cars being built there will be the objects.  Constructors are just the blue print that will take in inputs that can customize your car.  If you want a blue honda with black rims blue and black on that one specific car and may or may not be on the other cars depending on the inputs.
