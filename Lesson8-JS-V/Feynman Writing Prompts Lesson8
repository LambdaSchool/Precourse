Feynman Writing Prompts Lesson8

Constructors:
Classes (abstract objects) are used like templates and allow engineers to build
specific objects with similar properties and methods without repeating modules of code
unnecessarily. Lines of specific arguments (data specific to objects) are then able
to be passed into classes to complete specific objects with minimal use of computer
memory.  

'prototypes':
Prototypes allow engineers to build 'template - like' methods that can be used by
specific objects and provide specific returns. Classes have prototypes built into them.
The goal is to use as little server memory as possible.
