Callback Functions - A callback function is a function that is called as an
argument to another function.

'arguments' - 'arguments' is similar to an array that stores the data that we pass into
a function. It can be accessed from anywhere within the function. Although'arguments' is
similar to an array it does not contain all of the properties that an actual array has.

'prototype' - 'prototype' is a way of setting a method one time that every object in the 
class can access. This saves memory because the method doesn't have to be reproduced every
time that it is needed.

Constructors - A constructor is a method used for creating and initializing an object in a class.
