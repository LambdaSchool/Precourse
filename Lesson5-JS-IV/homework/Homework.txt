Callback Functions
	callbacks significantly reduce your code so you don't have to write as much code. It allows you to reuse information from previous functions into a new function. It is also known as a higher order function. It is a function that is passed to antoher function. 


arguments
	argument is an object which contains an array of the arguments used when the function is called.
