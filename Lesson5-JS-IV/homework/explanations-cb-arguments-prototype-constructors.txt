1. Callback Functions

A callback function is a function that allows another function be passed through as an argument of the original function. A callback function is able to be called within the original function.

2. `arguments`

The arguments object of a function store the arguments of a function into an array-like structure, which has a minimal number of properties. The arguments object and its properties can be called anytime within a function.

3. `prototype`

Prototype is a special property of a class that allows a method to be written once per class, and every object created from that class has access to a prototype's methods.

4. Constructors

Constructors are used to create classes, which are templates to create objects. This is similar to a blueprint of an object, that is able to create multiple copies of itself.
