Undefined and Null: Undefined means that the object does not exist. Null means it exists, but there is no value associated with it.
Truthiness: When a value is not true or false, it may be assigned a boolean value through type coercion.
Arguments object: an array-like object related to the arguments passed in a function.
Callbacks: inserting a function inside another function
More Array Methods:
Classes: contain objects that share the same properties.
Prototype: methods that can be accessed by all objects within a class.
