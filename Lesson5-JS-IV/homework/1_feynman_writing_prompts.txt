1. Callback Functions
A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument. Conventionally 'cb' is used to refer to a callback
function.

2. Arguments
Arguments that are passed to a function are saved in an array called 'arguments'. It's values can be accessed by indices (same as arrays)
in the same order they were passed into the function. It has a length-property.

3. Prototype
The prototype contains the functions every object of a class has access to. As a result, not every object has its own function, but uses
the one from its parent class. This saves performance.

4. Constructor
The constructor sets up an object of a class. It can be considered as a blueprint function that is able to take arguments and evaluate
them on class creation.
