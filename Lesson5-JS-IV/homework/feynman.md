  * Callback Functions - is when you want to pass a function to another function
	* `arguments` - lists all arguments, similar to an array in that it gives you the list of items when called, but different in ways I honestly don't know yet.
	* `prototype` - allows us to set a method once to give every object of that class access to it
	* Constructors - - a way to create a template for objects that share the same attributes.
