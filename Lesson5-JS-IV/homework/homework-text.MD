1) A callback function is the ability to pass functions as arguments to another function and get called back in a outer function.

2) Arguments are used in the parenthesis when functions are begin called which are the result of the keywords from the parameters that were initially passed to our function.


3) A prototype is a way of setting a method once and giving every object of that class access to that method. Making things simpler and not having to create thousands of class objects.

4) A constructor is a special method for creating and initializing an object that makes it easy to create multiple objects with the same properties and methods without having to keep repeating ourselves.
