	* `prototype`
	* Constructors

## Callback Functions

A callback function is a function passed to another function as an argument.
the function will be called back from the function at some later time.

## 'arguments`

When we define or declare a function we include any expected values to be passed to the function. 
These are called parameters and act as placeholder names for the actual values passed to the function.
Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called or invoked.
These arguments are contained in an array like data structure and are available throughout the function.
They share some characteristics of arrays, but the aguments object is not an array.
It is possible to convert the arguments object to an array with the Array.from() method eg.
var args = Array.from(arguments);
Or by using spread operator
var args = [...arguments];

## `prototype`

'prototype' refers to all the properties and methods available to an object
for example 'length' is a property of the arguments object
pop, push, shift and unshift are methods available to the array object

## Constructors

Constructors are functions used when we need to create many objects of the same type. It creates a blueprint
which we can use to create objects with the same properties. It also allows each object to have access to
any methods within the constuctor.
