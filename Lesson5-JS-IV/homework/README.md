# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions

1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions	when a function is sent to into another function to be called again
	* `arguments`	a built in object of JS that keeps track of all arguements passed to a function in an array
	* `prototype`	this is like a framework from which any new creation inherits properties and methods
	* Constructors	used as the blueprint to make an account of sorts used to initialize an object

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSIV` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
