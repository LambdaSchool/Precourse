* Callback Functions

Callback functions are when we use 'cb' to pass arguments into other functions (or into another function).

* `arguments`

Arguments are contained mostly like arrays, meaning you can use .length to iterate, inside of a function.

* `prototype`

A propotype is a way to set a method once and then to give every object in the class a value.

* Constructors

Also known as a class and is a template for making objects, which can them be used multiple times without recreating each one.
