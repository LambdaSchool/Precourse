Callback Functions:
A function used as an argument in another function. It really is as simple as that!

arguments:
a data structure that holds the arguments passed into a function.
It's kind of like an array, more like a superclass of an array, or something like that.

prototype:
making a prototype method makes a method for all objects of a certain class.
Thus we don't have to make a whole bunch of methods for each different class but can make one prototype method and use it on many different classes.

Constructors:
Are classes. You can use them to creat many similar objects that are initialized with the same keys.
