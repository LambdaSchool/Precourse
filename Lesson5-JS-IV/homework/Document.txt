Callback Functions
A callback function is a function passed to another function as it's parameter, and the callback function is called inside that other function.

Arguments
The arguments object is an array thats already inside every function. The array contains all the arguments that will be passed to the function.

Prototype
Every class has a prototype property, and you can use that property to give methods to all objects in that class.

Constructors
Constructors are used to make classes, which are templates for making objects that share the same properties and methods.(example- users on a website)
