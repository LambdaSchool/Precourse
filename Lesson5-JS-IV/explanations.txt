1. A callback is a function that's passed to a function. For example, if you call the addEventListener function
    for a button click, you have to pass in a callback function that says what'll happen when the button's clicked. 

2. The arguments keyword is an array-like object of all the arguments passed to a function.

3. Calling the prototype of a class-based function lets you add a method or property to that function. For example, 
    if I have 
    function VideoGame(title, console) {
        this.title = title;
        this.console = console;
    }
    
    then I can add a method to it like this:
    VideoGame.prototype.getInfo = function() {
        return `${this.title} is available on ${this.console}.`;
    }
    
4. A constructor is the setup code for making an object. It lets you pass in whatever properties you want and set them as
    internal properties, as well as run whatever initialization you choose.
