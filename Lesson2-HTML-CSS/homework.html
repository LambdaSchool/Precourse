          <span id="spanId" > My favorite food to eat are the soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) and sauteed string beans with garlic at a restaurant in Arcadia, CA called <a href="http://dintaifungusa.com/" target="_blank">Din Tai Fung</a> . The dumplings here are a little pricy, but there's a reason <a href="http://dintaifungusa.com/" target="_blank">Din Tai Fung</a> is the gold standard when it comes to soup dumplings. The Taiwanese XLB chain is stickler for quality. The skin is thin enough so that the interior of the bao becomes the star of the show. The soup is packed with a great pork flavor, but wait a while and you'll taste the hint of sweetness too. So yes, Din Tai Fung is actually worth all the hype.</span>
