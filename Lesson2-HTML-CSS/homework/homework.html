        <div class="divClass"><span id="spanId">Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs) stirred or beaten together in a pan while being gently heated, typically with salt and butter and various other ingredients.Only eggs are necessary to make scrambled eggs, but salt and pepper are often used, and other ingredients such as water, milk, butter, chives, cream or in some cases crème fraîche or grated cheese may be added. The eggs are cracked into a bowl; with some salt and pepper, and the mixture is stirred or whisked: alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot pan or skillet, and the whites and yolks stirred together as they cook. Ground black pepper is also sometimes used as an ingredient. More consistent and far quicker results are obtained if a small amount of thickener such as cornstarch, potato starch or flour is added; this enables much quicker cooking with reduced risk of overcooking, even when less butter is used
