                My favorite food is the Japanese beef bowl, or 牛丼 (<em>gyuudon</em>). As you may suspect, it's a bowl: a bowl filled with rice and topped with marinated beef and caramelized onions, and usually garnished with pickled red ginger and seasoning. It's the quintessential Japanese fast food; it's fast, delicious, and filling.

                <a href="https://www.yoshinoyaamerica.com/"><em>Yoshinoya</em></a> is a great place to get beef bowls day-to-day, but my favorite restaurant to eat it at is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hana-Ichimonme-268609959871054/"><em>Hana Ichimonme</em></a> at Downtown Los Angeles' Little Tokyo. The restaurant itself is a little like a time machine back to the 80's, but the food is beautifully presented, and delicately delicious.
