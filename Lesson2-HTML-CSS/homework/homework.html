                <p>Let me start off and say I love food in general and consider myself a foodie, however, my ultimate favorite food is good ol' comfort food that I grew up eating and that's Lao food. My parents are from Laos and I'm the first born U.S. Lao-American generation since they've immigrated here. Our food touches bases of sweet, savory, sour and bitter. As an entire culture we tend to lend to a lot of spicy and bitterness, but for me I prefer spicy and sour.</p>
                <p>My favorite dishes are fairly simple and nothing too extravagant. One dish I can eat daily and not become sick of is Kao Piek Sen, which is our version of chicken noodle soup. It's made with a lemongrass and ginger chicken broth and handmade tapioca and rice flour noodles that our sliced thinly and generously dusted in tapioca flour. The fresh noodles are cooked in the broth and the tapioca flour thickens the broth to give it almost a gummy texture that is synonymous with Kao Piek Sen. I grew up eating it with beef meatballs (the same ones you find in your pho noodle soup at pho restaurants across the nation) and chicken. It's usually topped with just soy sauce, cilantro, green onions and fried garlic. You can take it up a notch and add chili oil (preferably homemade), sriracha, lime juice, bean sprouts, chinese cruellers, dried pork, pork skin, or blood curds.</p>
                <p>My second favorite dish is Nam Khao, which is a crispy rice salad. The process is to fry ball like patties of rice to get the crispy texture and mix it with sour strands used to make som moo (sour fermentated pork sausage, also known as nam), diced up som moo, cilantro, green onion, more fresh herbs, lime juice and fish sauce. It's a dish that's not made often, but more for special occasions. It's often served with crushed peanuts and dried chili peppers. To eat it all you do is scoop some of the salad up and make yourself a lettuce wrap and enjoy!</p>
                <p>My favorite resturant here in the Atlanta Metro area is <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-lanxang-lao-thai-cuisine-forest-park">Pho Lanxang</a> in Forest Park, GA. They offer some delicious well-known Lao dishes on their menu.</p>
