       <span id="spanID">I wake up every morning with a mix of fresh fruits. Fresh juice drinks or fruit deserts are my favorite food, and still I only try to limit having them for breakfast because of the high sugar content. Foods high in sugar and carbohidrates are easier to digest in the morning hours before noon. When taken at the right time, fruits have healing properties due to the high levels of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and other nutrients in them. Their refreshing flavour and aroma wake up the senses and energize the body.</span>
