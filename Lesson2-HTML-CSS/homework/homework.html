                It is hard for me to pick a favortite between Italian and Mexican but if I only had one choice my favorite would be Fajitas.
            Steak, Chicken, Shrimp (not so much Shrimp any more, due to recent allergy development! ) All Tossed with some Sauteed Green, 
            Red, and Yellow Peppers and Onions. Sizzling with the right amount of seasonings with some salsa and cheese waiting to be 
            placed on some fresh hot tortillas! I'm salavating just thinking about it. My favorite resturant is this little Mexican Resturant that not 
            too many people know about called <a href="http://www.chellyscafe.com/">Chelly's Cafe</a> They have a Fajita Burrito that is sooooo DELICIOUS!</span>
