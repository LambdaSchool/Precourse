  G. Add a style rule to 'thirdDiv' changing the height to 600px and the width to 500px.
  I. Change the size of the font for 'spanId' to 18px.


III. Create an external style sheet and import all of our previous style rules into the new stylesheet.
  A. Find styles.css file in this folder.
  B. COPY all of your style rules to this new file. (Do not include the style tags!)
  C. Place: <!-- in front of your first style tag.
  D. Place: --> after your closing style tag.

IV. Add, Commit and push your work to your github account.

Extra credit:   
  In order to do some of this you will either need to have an understanding of CSS currently, or will need to 
  do some further homework, I recoomend the additional resources in the README or https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
