                I don't have a particular favorite food, but since I'm about the link a restaurant I like I want to talk about a restaurant near me that is very good. It's called Magic Grill, it's a monogolian buffet where you make your own noodle bowls. It's very tasty, and it's family run! Not many people go there unfortunately, so I try to go there when I can to help keep them in business. They give you so much good food for so cheap!
