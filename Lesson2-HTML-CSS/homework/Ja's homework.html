                <span id="spanId">I'm from Thailand.  Of course, my favorite food is Thai food, the combination of exotic flavors and aromatic spices which will simply satify your taste-buds. Hot and spicy Tom Yum soup and sweet and sour Pad Thai are the most well-known dishes.  The flavor of these two are completely contrast.  Like Australian chef David Thomson said "Thai food ain't about simplicity. It's about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish".  <em>Tucker, Ian (19 September 2010). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/19/bangkok-thai-street-food-david-thompson">"One night in Bangkok on the trail of Thai street food".</a> The Observer. London. Retrieved 29 October 2013.</em> Some says national cruisine represents the nation and its people.  I think that statement is quite true.  We are lively, friendly and easy-going. The best way to serve Thai food, in my opinion, should be in kind-of fun and homelike atmosphere.  Pok pok restaurant might be the best example. You can easily find that kind of colourful restaurants or food stalls everywhere in Thailand. But in my area - Asheville, NC my favorite Thai restaurant is <a href="http://www.ponsthaicuisine.com/">Pon's Thai Cruisine</a>, a little shop located in a gas station. The taste of their dishes just like in Thailand.</span>
