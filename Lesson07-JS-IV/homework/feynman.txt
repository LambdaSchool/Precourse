OBJECTS
Objects are a data storage type that stores values, not in a sequencial order, but identified by a Key name also known as a property.

PROPERTIES
Properties are the values stored in an object. They are identified and accessed in the object through the key name.

METHODS
Methods are functions that are stored in an object.

FOR IN LOOP
A 'for in loop' is a way to run a block of code for each property that an object has.

DOT NOTATION VS BRACKET NOTATION
Dot notation is the simplest way to access a property in an object. You use dot notation when you know the exact name of the property
you want to look up. You access the property with the notation object.property

You use bracket notation when you do not know the exact name of the property, but you have a variable that points to that name. You
access tha property with the notation object[variable]
