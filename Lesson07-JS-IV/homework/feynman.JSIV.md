Objects
	are similar to arrays. They are different because they hold a lot of information about one thing. So, instead of a bookshelf with books (an array), an object is like a bookshelf that contains books about only one topic (like math, for example).

Properties
	of an object give you the characteristics of that object. Pick any object. A dog has properties. It has a height, a weight, an age, a breed, a color and so on. 

Methods
	are things we can make objects do. They are basically the same thing as properties, but communicated differently. Think verb, action, something you can do.....to an object.

for in loop
	is a way to find out all of the characteristics (properties) of an object and how to describe them. 

Dot notation vs bracket notation
	are two different ways to say one thing. Dot notation is easier to use and read and is used more often. Something to remember is you can't use dot notation when a property starts wigh a number. Bracket notation is more forgiving and has less rules.
