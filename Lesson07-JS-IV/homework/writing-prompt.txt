everything in js is an object. we can add properties and methods to them.

properties are values that objects can hold. 

methods are functions that objects can hold.

a for in loop iterates over all key:value pairs in an object.

dot notation is the prefered way to access properties of object, but we can also use bracket notation. 
if we want to use bracket notation like we do an arrays, we have to use numbers or strings, we use bracket notation mostly when we access properties with variables.
