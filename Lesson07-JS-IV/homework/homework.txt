Feynman Writing Prompts
	* Objects
  Think of this as boxes that can contain
  many different boxes with instruction and that can
  be use to store complex information

	* Properties
  Think of this as descriptions of specific things inside of boxes
  like Objects

	* Methods
  Think of this as a set of instruction that create a complex
  activity inside an object

	* for in loop
	Think of this as a set of instruction that will go trough a list
	and look for a specific property

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
  Think of dot as looking for properties in objects and
  of bracket to look for properties more so in an array, a list.
