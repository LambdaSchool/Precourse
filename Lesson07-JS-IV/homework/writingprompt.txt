Objects: Objects are like bigger variables that can do a whole lot more, 
a variable is limited to one piece of information, whether it be an array, a 
function or just a plain old number. Object's on the other hand can hold any 
number of any type of variables called 'Properties'

Properties: Properties are the names of information stored in an object and 
can be used by using 'object.property'.

Methods: Method's are basically functions that are inside of an object. So 
instead of calling on a property and getting an array or a string back, you would
get an entire function returned which could itself return other information.

for in loop: 'In' is a funny word in programming, every language does it a little
bit different but it has the same literal meaning, 'in'. The most common way i've
used 'in' with programming is when I need to search for a value or a certain 
thing inside of an Array or Object istead of typing out really long code to 
look for what i want.

[] vs . : Dot and Bracket notation are a little funny when using Objects.
dot notation is what you use when calling a property within a function. However 
you can use bracket notation to call object properties as well. Like so,
'object[methodName]();' if it's a method your needing to call.
