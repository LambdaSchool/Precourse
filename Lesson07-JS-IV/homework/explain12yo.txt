Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12
year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on slack.

-objects // Similar to the array, objects are a collection of data. However they are dissimillar as well. 
Whereas arrays are like a list holding multiple items related to each other and are assigned a number.
Objects hold a lot of different information about one thing and are not in a particular order. The arguments
for objects are written in curly braces as well unlike the square brackets of the arrays.

-Properties // The properties for an object are like name tags that are assigned to each of the different arguments
for the object. Another name for them are keys. Whenever you wish to assign something for an object. Within the
curly braces the syntax is always the key or property followed by a colon followed by the value.

-methods // functions saved within an object, so it must be within the braces of the object syntax. Set a key to
a name, and the value to a function. You can call the method afterwards.

for in loop // slightly different syntax than the arrays, because there is no number index for objects. When
defining the for loop, add an in after the variable declaration and then the name of the object. This allows the
computer to iterate over all of the key:value pairs. You can also use the key and bracket notation to access the
value associated with that key.

dot notation vs bracket notation // the object name, dot and key name works like the .length property of an array.
This allows us to call the value associated with the key attached to it. The bracket notation is like calling an
item on an array, the syntax is the object and the key wrapped in brackets. This is used when accessing variables.
Or if the key is associated with an unknown value.
