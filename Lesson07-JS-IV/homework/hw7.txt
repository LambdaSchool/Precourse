1. Objects variables that contain usually a few properties that have value pairs

2. Properties name:value pairs such as name: 'persons name'  age: 'persons age'

3. Methods are actions that can be performed on an object

4. For in loops- loops through the properties of an object which is useful for something more complex like taking a few values of properties and stringing the together.

5. Dot vs bracket notation dot notation and brakes notation are 2 different ways of accessing properties on an object but there are some cases where bracket notation is preferable even though it is not as neat such as when a variable resolves to a string.
