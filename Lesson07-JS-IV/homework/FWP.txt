* Objects
Objects are containers that can store data in key-value pairs. An object can store data in any data type, including other objects.

* Properties
Properties are also called keys. These are the identifiers where values are assigned to.

* Methods
In objects, a key can also hold a function value. These are called methods of the object.

* for in loop
For in loop is a way to loop through each key of the object.

* Dot notation vs bracket notation
Dot and bracket notation are 2 different ways to access the properties of an object. There are a few differences between dot and bracket notations
    1. Dot notation cannot be used on properties a space in it. For example: Object.first property is invalid. Need to use Object['first property']
    2. Dot notation cannot be used on properties that start with a number. Object.1foo is invalid. Need to use Object['1foo']
