# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	Obects are ways to store related information in a list format. Objects are not ordered. You can assign Keys to identify the information -- or assign labels. 
	Everything in Javascript is an object

	* Properties
	Properties are the details that are listed in the object. 

	* Methods
	Methods are the actions that an object is programmed to do. These are customizable for the object data type. 

	* for in loop
	For in loop is used in objects. Comparatively, there is the For loop that is used in arrays. 

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
	Dot notation is used when you specifially know the variables/keys or properties that you can call by name. Bracket notation is general and is used when you need to call something you don't necessarily know the pathway to or the name of. 

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
