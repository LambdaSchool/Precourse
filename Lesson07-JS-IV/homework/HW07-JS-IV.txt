Objects - One of the ways used to store data in an unordered format.
It is in a key:value format.  The stored information can be of any form, i.e. number, string, array,
object, function.

Properties - It is a key:value pair in objects.  I.e. You can remove a
property from an object by using (delete objectName.key)

Methods - a function inside an object.

for in loop - used for iterating through key:value in objects.  Regular
for loops can't be used because objects has unordered indices.

Dot notation vs bracket notation - used for retrieving specify value in objects.
Dot notation (objectName.key). bracket notation (objectName['key']).
