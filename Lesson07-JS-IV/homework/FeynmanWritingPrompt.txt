Hi again!

I'm going to tell you about objects, which is basically a drawer.

* Objects are like a dresser. They hold things in order, just like you would have drawers for shoes, shirts, socks, underwear, etc.

	* Properties are a fancy word for the items in the object. For example, the object Charles may have an property called Age. I'm turning 25 tomorrow (YAY!) so my Age property will have a value of 25.

	* Methods are just like functions: It does things like, math, giving names, etc, but inside of the object. You could make a function called "sayHi" which would create computer text that says hi to you!

	* for in loop: The for in loop is a special kind of loop that works with objects! Arrays use I which corresponds with numbers. The for in loop uses the name of the property & object so javascript knows what to look for.

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation: Bracket notation is written as object[method] ; this works when you don't know exactly what the value is, because it will allow javascript to search for what it means.

Dot notation is written as object.method, which is helpful when the properties are numbers, letters, have _, and $. But there can't be any open spaces like-->      <--that. You also can't use variables with dot notation.

Bracket notation works with properties that have spaces, and any characters, and also variables! It's a better way to access properties.
