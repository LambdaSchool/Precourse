Objects hold a lot of info about one thing. they are a list of items with keys and values.

Properties: are keys which are identifiers and the value is the value we want to save to that key.

Methods
in objects values can be set to functions. functions saved on an object are called methods

for in loop
when we wan to go over each key:value pair in our object we can design a for..in loop which will loop over each key in the object and finish when all the keys have been gone over.

Dot notation vs. bracket notation

dot notation and bracket notation are used to access the properties on an object. dot notation is used most frequently.

Dot notation:
Property identifies can only be alphanumeric (and _ and $)
Property identifiers cannot start with a number.
Property identifiers cannot contain variables.
OK — obj.prop_1, obj.prop$
Not OK — obj.1prop, obj.prop name
Bracket notation:
Property identifiers have to be a String or a variable that references a String.
It is okay to use variables, spaces, and Strings that start with numbers
OK — obj["1prop"], obj["prop name"]
