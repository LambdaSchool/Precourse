1) Objects are similar to arrays but instead of having all data types separated by spaces for similar items we have key and value pairs just like we would in a dictionary for a word and a definition.

2) Properties are the key: value pairs that we define inside of objects. Properties is the word used to describe the connection between a key/value pair combined together.

3) Methods are functions that are inside of objects. When we invoke/call methods we do it by calling it on the object that we put the method inside.

4) A for in loop is used to iterate through the properties in a object, similar to a for loop iterating through an array.

5) We use bracket and dot notation in objects to access values, reassign values or set new values to properties.
