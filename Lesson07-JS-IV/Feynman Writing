1.) Objects are a type of data structure which are used to describe what we might think of as everyday objects. For instance,
a dog could be an object, and from that, there are many things we can use to say describe what a dog is. 

2.) Properties are some of these "things" on objects, such as name and breed (for the dog example). They consist
of key value pairs such as name: "Ty". 

3.)  Methods are simply functions that the key of an object contains. They can be a part of objects, built-in 
or created by the programmer.

4.) For in loops are used for iterating over the keys of objects. They can be used for arrays, but are
best to be used for plain objects.

5.) Dot notation and bracket notation are two ways of accessing values on an object. Bracket notation allows for 
accessing a key using a variable name.
