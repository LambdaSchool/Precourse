1) Objects are like dictionaries. They have keys that describe what we will define and a value which defines the key. Object can have as many key/value pairs inside of them as we like. The values inside of an object can be any kind of data type.

2) Properties is the key/value pairs combined together.

3) Methods are functions that we create inside of objects. We can have a method execute a specific task or calculate values just like regular functions do. The method will be executed through the object though and we can make an object perform certain actions with a method.

4) A for in loop is similar to a for loop, but we use for in loops to iterate through object keys instead of arrays. A regular for loop can not be used in objects because objects are not indexed like arrays are.

5) We can use bracket notation or dot notation to gain access or assign a value to properties in objects.
