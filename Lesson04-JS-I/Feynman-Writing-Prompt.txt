A variable is something that stores some sort of information that can be called upon in place of the information.

A string is a combination of letters or numbers inside of quotes.

A function takes in variables as arguments and performs a task with the variables to return a response.

If statements set a requirement to be met before doing a certain task and if that requirement is not met it can set another or just end up returning something else

Boolean Values are either True or False and can be used to be set as values or in If statements as a condition to be met or to return a value.
