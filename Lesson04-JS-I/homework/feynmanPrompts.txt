<!-- 1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) -->

1) Variables are containers that hold a piece of data so it can be accessed later in the code.

2) Strings are groups of characters surrounded by quotes " ". It is used to store plain text.

3) Functions are a way of storing a chunk of code to be run at a later point, possibly over and over,
	in the code. Arguments are data we can pass in to the function when we call it to run. The return
	statement is what will output from the block of code after we run it.

4) 'if' statements use a conditional statement to decide whether to execute the block of code attached.

5) Boolean values are simple bianary values. They can be only 'true' or 'false'. They can be the result
	of a conditional statement, and be stored in a variable for later use in the code.
