* Variables
- Variable is like the label of a jar where you can store cookie(s) in it.
    eg. var rollNo = 1;

* Strings
- String is the collection of characters which shows the output defined in pair of single/double quotes.
    'Strings are the collection of a string.'
    eg. var favoriteGame = "Chess" //output Chess;
        
         
* Functions (arguments, `return`)
- Functions are the building-block of statements which are use to perform specific tasks.
    eg. If you are going to play football, where your 'legs' will act as a pararmeter for a function named as 'kick'. And your goal will count as `return` value.

* `if` statements
- This statement checks whether a condition is matched or not. It can also be in nested form.
    eg. You are visiting to an ice-cream shop. There you have a choice to buy any ice-cream or go to home. You'll choose to buy an ice-cream. There you've to choose the ice-cream flavor. Later you'll buy a butterscotch flavor ice-cream. 
    In that way it can be go further until you get desired answer.
    
* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
- Boolean is like the electricity switch, having two states to be performed simultaneously. 
    eg. If you're going to buy an Xbox One at shop, which would be out of stock. Then you'll come back to home instead of buying PS4. Perhaps, 'do it now or not'.
