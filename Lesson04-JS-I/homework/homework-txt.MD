1) Variables are used to store values as data types. We can think of them as a box that store information inside. The box(variable) can have a label describing what information that it will contain.

2) Strings are text surrounded by single or double quotation marks.

3) Functions are used to perform tasks or to calculate values. We can pass them parameters as input data and when we call our function we pass them arguments in the order that we passed in the parameters so we get back a desired output. We use return statements inside of functions so the function can return us a value from within the function. The return statement makes the function stop executing and will not return us anything after the return statement, and only the return statement itself.

4) We use if statements to evaluate if a certain condition is true or false.

5) Boolean values return either true or false. We can think of them like switches for ON or OFF, YES or NO. We can also compare them to binary numbers as 0 and 1, where 0 is false and 1 is true.
