1) Variables are used to store data types. We can think of them like boxes that contain a label in front of it to describe what kind of data that it will store inside.

2) Strings are one of the data types that exists in JavaScript. Strings are used to encapsulate characters inside of them. A string can be used either with single or double quotes. Example: "I am a string!" or 'I am a string!'.

3) Functions are used to complete specific tasks we desire it to execute. It takes in inputs and executes outputs back to us. We can define variables in the paranthesis of a function which are also called parameters. When we call/invoke the function we pass in arguments in the same order that we defined our parameters to. When these parameters are defined inside of a function they are considered local scope variables. We can return anything inside of a function including the parameters that we define. The code will stop executing as soon as the return statement is executed and if any code is put after the return statement it will not run.

4) We use if statements to determine whether conditions are true or false. We run certain conditions based on certain values. Whichever condition returns true first will be executed. If none of the conditions are true, it will return the false value.

5) Boolean values are like numbers 0 and 1 in binary code. 0 is false and 1 is true. We can also think of them like switches for on or off, yes or no evaluations. Which true is on and false is off. Yes is true and no is false. It will return whether something is true or false.
