1. Variables allow us to store the value of something. They can they be altered and refernced, to help give instructions to the computer. 

2. Strings are blocks of text that can also be referenced just like variables. They are defined by using quotation marks.

3. Functions are ways to alter the variable and strings to make them useful to us. We can make the copmuter perform certain actions with functions/ 

4. If statements allow us to test the conditions of a statement and then perform certain actions based on whether the conditions are met.

5. Boolean values are data types that only hold two values: true or false.
