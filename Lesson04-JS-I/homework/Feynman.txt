Write explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining them to a 12 year old:


VARIABLES
Variables in programming languages are similar to variables used in algebra. A variable is a letter or word that represents something else.
In the most recent versions of Javascript, there are several ways to create (or "declare") a variable. Each way does something slightly different.
The old way of declaring variables is to use the keyword "var". For some reason, it has fallen out of style.
There are two new ways, with a key difference between them. Using the keyword "const" creates a variable that is immutable, which means it cannot
be edited once created. Using the keyword "let" creates a mutable variable, which can be edited after it has been created.

Examples:
const favoriteFood = 'Bread';
let sliceCount = 12;


STRINGS
A string is a type of data in Javascript. A string is text and is surrounded by quotation marks, either the single (') or double (") marks.
A string can contain numbers and letters.

Examples:
'My name is Clark.'
"It is quite nice 2 meet you."


FUNCTIONS
Functions are the neat part of Javascript because they allow the programmer to create pages with dynamic content.
Typically, a function takes inputs (called "arguments"), manipulates them according to the rules of the function, then returns a result.
If a function has an argument, the function must be "passed" an argument when the function is called, otherwise you'll get an error.
The argument acts as a variable that can be used within the function.

Example:
function addOne(number) {
    sum = number + 1;
    return sum;
}
addOne(10) // 11


IF STATEMENTS
If statements allow programmers to use something called "conditionality," which is a fancy word for something you're already familiar with.
The basic idea of If Statements is "if THIS is true, do THAT." You can also stack If Statements to create something like
"if X is true, do Y; otherwise, do Z."

Example:
function canDrink(age) {
    if (age >= 21) {
            return "Yes. Please drink responsibly.";
        }

    return "No alcohol for you. Please wait until the Earth circles the Sun a bit more.";
}
canDrink(23) // "Yes. Please drink resonsibly."


BOOLEAN VALUES
The word "boolean" refers to two opposing options, as in "0 or 1" and "Yes or No" and "True or False." It's either one or the other.
