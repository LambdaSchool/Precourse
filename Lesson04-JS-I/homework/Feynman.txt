Feynman Method Homework.

Variables:
    in programing one of the key functions is assigning values to to keys known as variables.
    This makes it easier to call and access the associated data.

Strings:
    strings are used to store sets of characters as data. It is oe of the 3 most basic data types.
    this is used for all sets of charecters like words, setntences, and even paragrapgs. 
    Strings can also hold numbers (althoughy they act differntly). Strings are noted by
    parentheses.

Functions:
    we use functions to take in some data in the for of parameters, perform some action with those
    parameters, and return the end result. Keep in mind that the return value is the only way to
    output. The data provided to the function to work with is then called an arguement.

IF Statements:
    If statements are how computers use basic logic to make cjoices in what to do next. By writing 
    an if statement you tell the program which set of comands to execute by feeding in for
    instance IF some peice of data equals this then do this, or ELSE do this. ELSE being the
    other option.

Boolean Values:
    At the most basic level computing is all true or false. These are known as booleans.
