Variables:
Variables are little shortcuts for information, for example you can set 
"var i = 'apples'" and that gives 'i' a value of the word 'apples' unless
you change it again which is as easy as "i = 'oranges'".

Strings:
Think of strings as variables that are only text. No numbers or weird decimel
places. For example a variables called "soup" that has a value of "The soup is 
Good" is a string.

Functions:
Functions are like little programs inside your script. You use them to get 
specific things done. Like checking is someone is a certain age or seeing if
certain variables are dividable by other numbers.

'if' statements:
if statements are super useful when checking for certain things.
For example you could have a variable called "one" that has a value of '1'
(number not the written character "1") and you could write out a short "if"
statement to check if 'one' is really equal to 1, and if it's not then that's
where the good old "else" comes in, because in this case if 'one' is not equal
to '1' then it will tell us.
