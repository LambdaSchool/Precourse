1. Feynman Writing Prompts:
* Variables:
Think of this as boxes that store values that we will use in the future.
They may be empty, have a number or a word, or even a function.
We have 3 different boxes.
VAR is one that can be emptied and
can be filled with stuff from another box, it
also is aware of what everyone else is carrying inside.
CONST is a box that can't be emptied.
LET is a box that knows only what very close boxes around it has.

* Strings
Think of strings as a string of letters and spaces that makes either
a sentence or a work. Simple, no?

* Functions (arguments, `return`)
Think of functions as a set of instructions that this box will do
using some other boxes inside. It has empty spots where you could
put Strings or Variable for the function to run, and those are arguments.
The result of the set of instructions is whatever it returns.

* `if` statements
Think of if statements as a condition the box needs to pass
in order for it to use its instructions and return us the value.

* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
Think of Booleans as a light switch. On or off. True or false.
