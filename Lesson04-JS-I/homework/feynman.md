Variables
	are words you use to store information to use later, like a piggy bank or savings account.

Strings
	are any type of text with quotation marks around them. 

Functions (arguments, return)
	are directions for a task, and you can repeat them.

if Statements
	tell you to do something if a condition is true, otherwise you make another choice or choose to do nothing at all.

Boolean Values (true, false)
	are the heart of computer--they make them run. Booleans are either true or false.
