Variables- variables store information to be used later. 

Strings- strings are text and are placed between 'single quotes'

Functions- functions are used to perform tasks in a program.
The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.

Arguments and parameters:-
Arguments- the actual value you are putting in the function. 
Parameters- the general term...like a number
Arguments are specific and change, parameters are general.

Return- is the output of the function. The result of what the code resolves to.

'if' statements- are used as a way for our function to check if something is 'true' and either to run the code or move on if it is not.

Boolean values ('true','false') boolean values are two choices of true or false, the concept comes from binary code.
