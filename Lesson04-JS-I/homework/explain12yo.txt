1. Feynman Writing Prompts- Ina a seprate text file that you create,
write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.
Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on slack.

- Variables // The word variable in math, i assume comes from the word vary. Vary means, to differ
in size, or nature or in some degree, it essentially means not-same. Variables can be anything, it is
a substitution or a place holder of some unit. If it is a color, it can be blue, red, yellow etc.
If it is a number, 0, 1999, -500 etc. In coding, it works in a similar way, it is a place holder that
can change to one's liking.

- Strings // strings are always in quotes, double or single. strings in coding are literal texts
that are transfered from input to output. Unlike variables, they do not change.

- Functions // A function is like a little program that instructs the computer or compiler to do
a certain task. the anatomy of a function is: declaring that it is a function, followed by the name 
of the function, the argument/s and then the function body which are instructions on what kind of
small program we wish to create, this can involve a wide variety of mathematical operations, combining
or disassembling sub tasks, etc.
    
    a. arguments // arguments are the variables we input for a function

    b. returns // retruns are the end product of the function, once the function recognizes
    a return statement it will output the result of the function.

- if-statements // if statements are instructions to choose between two alternative courses of action.
if the conditions of one request is made, it will perform the operations necessary for it, if not it
will choose the alternative course of action.

- Boolean values (true, false) // boolean values are simply two choices, true or false, yes or no,
0 or 1 in binary language. they go hand in hand with if statements.
