Variables: 
varibles have a name that we decide, and can hold any value (number, string, bool, function, etc).
variables can be declared as let (we can later change them) or as const (they are constant, not changeable).

Strings:
strings are holding characters, any text surrounded by quotes or double-quotes is a string. 

Functions (arguments, return):
functions can hold the logic to do something. we can make functions that take parameters, for example a number or a string. a function can return a value.

if statements:
we can write logic with if statements. only if something is true, or smaller, or bigger or equal something should the code after the if statement execute.

Boolean values (true, false):
like the 0's and 1's in our computers basic level. something can be either true or false. for example 2 == 3 is false.
