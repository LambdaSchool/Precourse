1.) Variables are words that developers create to describe pieces of information. They should be descriptive. 
The are good for when they need to store data for later use. Without storing data, it disappears as soon as it 
is used. 

2.) Strings are what we think as words in a spoken or written language. It would be like the words I am typing now.
In programming, you have to put quotes, either double, single or backticks, to tell the computer that it is a string.

3.) Functions are pieces of code that have a purpose. They could output something to the console or do some other 
side effect or they can return a meaningful value by using the word "return." Return is a keyword in javaScript. 
Some functions require more information or input to do their job. This input is known as arguments. 

4.) If statements are what programs use for decision making. When the expression within the if statement is true,
the code within the braces is run. When it is false, it will move down to various else if and finally run the code 
within the else block if none of the other choices are true. This is like a fork in the road where the computer makes
a decision. 

5.) A boolean is a special data type in javaScript and also has to do with computer science. They are related to 
the zeros and ones that make up the binary code that computers understand. A zero corresponds to false and means the 
absence of the process. A one turns it on and does the opposite of the zero.
