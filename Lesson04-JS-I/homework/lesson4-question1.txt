LAMBDA PRE-COURSE - LESSON 4 - JAVASCIPT 1
Qustion 1:
Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.                
        * Variables
        * Strings
        * Functions (arguments, `return`)
        * `if` statements
        * Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

variables: 
Varibles store data into keywords.  That data contained within can be easily accessed by calling the keyword.

strings: 
Strings are a data type that contain letters and text.  A sentence is an example of a string.  A sentence has no numerical (or other) value, just a bunch of words stuck together.  A number (or other value) can be typed into a string, but can not be used for mathematical purposes.


Functions (arguments, ‘return’)
Functions are processes or programs that perform actions.  Functions take inputs, which are called arguments.  Return will allow the result of the function to be accessed outside of the self-contained function/program.  It will also stop the function process from continuing to run.


‘if ‘ statements
If statements run inside of a function.  These take parameters to be met, and return a result (or output).  If the parameter(s) are not met, the function will move onto the next step, doing something Else.


Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
These can be used for comparison and are very black or white.  Either yes or no, on or off for example..
