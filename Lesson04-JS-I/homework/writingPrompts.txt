1.) Variables are like nouns. They give something a name, and the name should be descriptive, but isn't required to be. 

2.) Strings are non-numeric. You can put numbers in them, but JavaScript will see it like the word for the number and not the number itself. Like 3 vs three.

3.) Functions are verbs, you do things with them. Even if it's something as simple as saying "say this", a function is how you do it. Ryan Gosling in Drive is a function -- you give him a time and a place, and he does the driving.

4.) "if" statements, also conditional statements, are actually conditional unlike "If you need anything, my name is Jill". In JavaScript, "if" you need anything, my name is Jill. "else", my name is Beyonce.

5.) Boolean values are yes/no values. You can search with them in Google too, with AND, OR, and NOT.
