Variables:
Variables are like containers, you can store things (values, words, equations) in them so that you can use them later in a number of different ways. 

Strings:
Strings are just plain text, they are changeable later and can be stored in variables

Functions (arguments, `return`):
Functions are a sort of blueprint, you put code into a function a then can call that function later, and as many times as needed.
You can pass arguments (could be strings, ints, booleans, objects) that the function can then use to manipulate.

`if` statements:
If statments can move code along if a certain condition is met, for example if a number is equal to 5, then you can execute specific
code for that outcome.

Boolean values (`true`, `false`):
Booleans are a good way to report if an outcome is met, you can set a boolean at the end of a function, then somewhere else in your code, 
check that boolean and depending on if its true or false, perform certain actions.
