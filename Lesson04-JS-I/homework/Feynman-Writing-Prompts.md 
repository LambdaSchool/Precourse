* Variables
	* Strings: Strings are pieces of code that aren't numbers. Any word or piece of text can be a string. 

	* Functions (arguments, `return`): Functions are little programs that run code or instructions that you assign to that function. 
    Each function has some arguments or rules that you assign to it in order to return those values when you request them. 

	* `if` statements: 'if' statements are conditional statements. What it means is that certain conditions in the code must be met
    for the code to pass. A real life example would be: If you get good grades in school, then you can go to the movies on the weekend. 

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`): "Boolean values" are values that are assigned to specific parts of the code. 
    When these pieces of code meet certain criteria then they are labeled as true or false.
