# Feynman Writing Prompts

# variables
Variables are containers for other things. 
If I ask for a variable, what I'm really asking for is whatever is inside the box.
If I make a `const` variable, I'm putting something inside the box that I'm not going to change.
If I make a `let` variable, I'm assuming that I'm going to sometimes change what's in the box.

# strings
Strings are a bunch of letters or numbers in a row.
You don't really do anything to them.
It's like writing on a piece of paper. You can put a string inside a variable, like putting a piece of paper in a box.
If you call the variable later, you'll pull out that string.

# functions (arguments, return)
A function is like a set of instructions.
If I teach you how to make a sandwich, I give you a set of instructions for making a sandwich.
That's a function. If I give you bread and peanut butter, you know how to make a sandwich with it.
If I give you pita bread and mayonnaise and pork, you still know how to make a sandwich with it, because as long as I give you the right information, you're able to follow the instructions the same way every time.
The things I give you to make the sandwich, to follow the instructions, to perform the function (all the same thing) are the arguments.
Return is when you finish following my instructions and hand back a sandwich.
Or maybe the instruction would be to return to me whatever is left over. 
Return is what you bring out of the room where you make the sandwich.
If I tell you to make a sandwich, but to return with the sandwich, then that is what is returned.
If I tell you to make a sandwich, but to return with the leftovers, then that is what is returned.

# if statements
And if statement is a fork in the road.
It's where I give you instructions to get somewhere or do something, but I know that at some point you're going to have to make a decision.
You have to go to grandma's house, but there's a fork in the road.
Which one do you take?
I can say, if this, then take the left road, but if that, then take the right road.
Since I won't be with you while you're traveling, the if statement tells you what the right next move is even if I'm not there.

# Boolean values (true, false)
A boolean value is either true or false.
It's the answer to a question
In the set of instructions, for example, I can ask whether or not you have mayonnaise.
If the answer is `false`, then I might have you make a different sandwich.
If the answer is true, make a pork sandwich.
