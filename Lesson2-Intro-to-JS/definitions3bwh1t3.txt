variables - a named item that can be given a value, or defined, in a program. 
They can be coded by the programmer or input by the user and can remain constant or change. 
For example, you may want to write a program that asks each user for their favorite
sports team. You could assign the variable name in this case to something like 
favorite_team. If your user answered "Washington Redskins" the variable definition could
look like favorite_team = Washington Redskins. Variables can be constant or can change.
There are several classes of variables such as integers, strings, and boolean.

strings - a type of variable that has semantic meaning or value as understood
through natural languages. Commonly this would be a series of characters, such as 
"Washington Redskins" or "Hello World!" which represents the thing that you interpret
from reading it. Think of it as an exact snapshot of characters
that have no meaning other than interpreting at face value. For example, 'woiefoijser'
is a string of characters, but ones which one would likely be interpreted as gibberish.

Functions (arguments, 'return') - A section of computer code, that 
performs a specific task as defined by the programmer. It can often be used to consolidate code or stored for the 
purposes of calling up again later in the same program. 

'if' statements - A section of code that allows the programmer or executor to evaluate whether
an argument or statement is true. For example if your betime is 10 p.m. and it is 
only 9 p.m. the argument of whether it is your bedtime or not would be false.
The code includes two sets of different instruction where one set is executed
if the argument is true and the other set if it is false.  

Boolean values - a type of variable where there are two possible answers. For example
true or false. Also, yes or no; On or off.
