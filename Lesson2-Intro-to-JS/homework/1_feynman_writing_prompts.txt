1. Variables:
Variables are containers for specific data. They can hold letters,
words, numbers and other values. The specific value determines the
variable's type. A variable can be a constant, which means its value
can not be changed later on. Each variable has a scope, so it's
possible that you can not access it everywhere in the program.


2. Strings:
A string can be a character/word or a combination of characters/words. 
It can also contain numbers, but those are not considered as numbers 
in a mathematical sense.


3. Functions (arguments, return):
Functions are blocks of code which can be repeated when the respective
function is called. It receives arguments which can be processed by
the function to return a value as a result.


4. if statements:
If statements are used to distinguish between different cases in a 
program. If an if statement's condition is true, the commands
assigned to this particular statement are executed. If the condition
is false, either an else statement's commands are executed or - if
there is no else statement connected to the initial if statement - 
nothing happens.


5: Boolean values (true, false):
Boolean values can be either true or false. They can be used in if 
statements to evaluate whether commands assigned to an if statement
should be executed or not.
