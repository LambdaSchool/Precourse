Variables - like a box, variables are used to store something. You place value in the variable, 
lable it, and use it anytime later 

Strings - a group of words or a phrase, just like we use names to identify people, strings are used to 
identify variables 

Functions (arguments, return) - groups of commands that create change onto the variables, and can be reused 
Passing an argument will cause the variable to change, and returning it will show the product 

if statements - these are used to show if something is true or false, as well as variations of greater than,
less than, equal to, and not equal to

Boolean values (true, false) - a very basic computer science concept represented by a 0 or a 1 
in JS it represents true or false
