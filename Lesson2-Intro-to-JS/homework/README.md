# Homework: Introduction to Javascript, JSI

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables: A way to store information when the information will need to be called upon later.
	* Strings: A series of characters contained between quotes.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`): Lines of code that can be called upon to run.
	* `if` statements - Run one block of code if the condition passed to it is true, runs another block of code if the condition passed to it is false.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - Can be passed to if statements to determine which code block to run.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSI` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
