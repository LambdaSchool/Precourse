# Homework: Introduction to Javascript, JSI

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables - Container that holds different types of content (strings, integers, float, array, objects, etc.)
	* Strings - A list of characters 'this is a string'
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) - Arguments are variables that are passed into a function.  The `return` statement is what is returned when the function is called.  A `return` statement will end the function and continue your code after the final } that ends the function.
	* `if` statements - A block of code that will run if the statement evaluates to be true.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - When evaluating statements, code will return a true (yes) or false (no)


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSI` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
