# Homework: Introduction to Javascript, JSI

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables	can be used to hold a particular data and can be changed throughout the program so long as it wasnt created using "const", they can then be reused indefinitely.
	* Strings	stores characters that have been strung together in a set order and can then be referenced and reused indefinitely.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)    gives a name to a method to then be reused multiple times, arguements can gather data for the requested method and return is used to supply the result
	* `if` statements	these allow programs to have a logic component that can be used to control the flow of how the program should function based on the current situation.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)  these 2 allow us to make comparison or statements that allow us to assess the situation and choose waht to due in if statements


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSI` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
