# Homework: Introduction to Javascript, JSI

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Variables = We use variables to store data as values. We can think of them as boxes with a name tag on it that holds values into them.
	* Strings = A block of text that is surrounded by single or double quotes. We we use strings to describe something and usually assign them to variables.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) = Functions are used to perform a task or to calculate values. We pass them arguments to be used later on when we're calling them. When we want a function to return us a value we use the return keyword. It will stop executing any code after the return keyword and will only return us what we asked it to return us.
	* `if` statements = If statements are used to check if a certain condition is true or false.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) = Boolean values are used to check if a condition is either ON or OFF, YES or NO. When we write if statements we get booleans values back to us. When we compare numbers we also get booleans and many other comparisons also returns us boolean values.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSI` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
