My Explanations
===============

## Variables
A variable is a placeholder or container, like in algebra, to hold some kind of information that we want to use later.

## Strings
A string is a type of data, or information, that is handled by the computer as text. In computer programs, strings will be surrounded by quotes - either single or double depending on the programming language. 


## Functions (arguments, `return`)
A function is a set of instructions or actions that produce an output with some input that it's given.


## `if` statements
An `if` statement controls the flow of a program. It's like a fork in the road. We use `if` statements in programs to check to see if something is true, and do a certain thing if it is. If our check turns out to be false, then we tell our program to do something else. 


## Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
A Boolean value is either true or false. We evaluate boolean expressions to determine whether they are true or false. For example, the boolean expression 10 > 2 ("ten is greater than two") is true.
