Feynman Writing Prompts - 1/24/18

Variables: A variable is something we use to store values that can be used later. In a real life scenario, our variable can be named John. John can store his value, a toolbox, for later use.

Strings: Strings are the individual words that you write down on your paper. Pony is a string. All of the words that written are strings, block of texts.

Functions: Functions are the actions that you take to do anything. So when you're kicking a ball, your leg is assigned all sorts of functions to complete it's task, which is to kick that ball!

if statements: An if statement is exactly what it sounds like, it's an if statement. If you are old enough to drive, you can. If you aren't old enough to drive, you can't.

Boolean values (true, false): Boolean values are similar to a lightswitch, they are either on or off. We write true or false instead of on or off.
