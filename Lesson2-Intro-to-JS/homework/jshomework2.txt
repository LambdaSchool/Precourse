Variables-A variable is a value that acts as a container for a
value that you assign to it, or more accurately the location in
memory of that value.

Strings-A string is a sequence of characters contained in quotes.

Functions-A function is code that performs a task contained within
a variable so that it can be reused as many times as is necessary.
A function takes in data called arguments represented by 
parameters written into the function.

'If' statements-If statements are used as a conditional branch
when coding. If the given data meets a given condition, one block of
code is executed. Otherwise that block is skipped and another is 
evaluated until either the end of the statement is reached or
criteria for one of the blocks of code are met.

Boolean Values-Boolean values are either true or false based on
one data set being compared to another.
