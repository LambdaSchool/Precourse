Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining
it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Variables: These store values such as numbers, phrases, individual letters, equations and other types of data that can be accessed later. 
            It is like a dictionary definition that you can create and access whenever you'd like. Look at it like this, the keyword (var) is 
            the dictionary and the name and value provide the definitions. It will look like the following: var word = 'definition';
            
Strings:    Strings are text that are surrounded by single or double quotation marks. Anything you surround in these quotation marks will be looked
            at as a string. It will look like the following: var phrase = 'Work hard, Play hard!';

Functions (arguments, return):  Functions are somewhat like variables. Only, a function runs whatever code you put inside its brackets.
                                It will look like the following: function myFunction() {} 

if statements: if statements control the flow of a function. It checks to see whether or not the result of the code is true or not.
                It will look like the following: if (10 > 9) { return true; }

Boolean values (true, false): Boolean values are either true or false. There is no in between. If the result or value of something does not
                              have the same meaning, value or sometimes data type, it will equal False. Vice versa. It will look like the following:
                              10 > 9 = true
                              9 > 10 = false
