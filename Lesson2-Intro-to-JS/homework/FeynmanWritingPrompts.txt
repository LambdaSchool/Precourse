Variables
Variables are placeholders of information. They hold values that you or a program tell it to.

Strings
Strings are text. They are the words and letters you read and type on your screen.

Functions (arguments, return)
A function is a set of instructions that are executed using the arguments passed to them. 
The function can also return the value produced by the instructions, back to who called the function.

if statements
An if statement compares two or more conditions and executes a set of instructions based on those conditions.

Boolean values (true, false)
A boolean value is what is determined after a condition is analyzed. For example, if I'm comparing 1 to 2,
and want to know if 2 is greater than 1, the boolean value for this condition is defined as true.
