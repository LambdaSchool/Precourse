A variable is a unit that stores data in a keyword.

A string is an series of characters stored as one piece of data.

A function is a block of code that can take arguments and return a value
 and can be used many times in a given program.

if statements are a decision making structure that allows you to branch
into different sections of code depending on a certain condition.

Boolean values are data types that can only store two values: true and
false. They are used to determine if something is true or false and
to branch into different parts of the program in either case.
