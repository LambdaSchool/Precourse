\b Variables:
\b0  Objects to which a value is assigned. This value can be of many different types, including integers (numbers), strings (words), or booleans (true or false evaluators).\

\b Strings:
\b0  A type of data that defines a group of characters that generally create something like a word. For example, a string could be \'93acd\'94 or \'93Feynman\'94 or \'93number\'94.\

\b Functions (arguments, return): 
\b0 Functions are objects that take in data types called arguments to return certain answers. Basically, a function is a question that asks for certain details, which are the arguments, and give an answer, which is the returned value.
\b \
if statements: 
\b0 If statements are pathways that evaluate whether certain parameters have been fulfilled. If these parameters have been fulfilled, the program will act one way. Otherwise, an else statement will cause it to default to another way.\

\b Boolean values (true, false): 
\b0 Boolean values are another data type that boil down to whether a parameter has been fulfilled or not.}
