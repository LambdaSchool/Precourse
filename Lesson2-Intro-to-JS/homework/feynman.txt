Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

1. Variables - a variable is a way to store the value to use later on. Can be set and reset later on. 
There are 3 ways to declare a variable: 
- var: ES5 way (old)
	var firstName = "Angela";
- let: ES6 way; similar to var
	let favColor = "Blue";
- const: ES6 way ; short for constant and does not change
	const favMovieGenre = "Action"

2. Strings - is a basic data type used in Javascript and other programming languages. It is a block of text that is defined by single or double quotations. 
let dog = "Rover";
let cat = 'Fluffy';

3. Functions (arguments, return) - a function starts with the word function and basically tells the program that it is a function and has a set of arguments/instructions on what to do. 

function greeting (name) {
	console.log ("Hello " + name);
}
greeting("Angela");
This will output: "Hello Angela"

Return statement is a way for data to "escape" the function, the function will have to return the statement.

function sum(x,y) {
	const addNum = x + y;
    return addNum;
}
sum(8,9);
This will output: 17

4. if statements - if statements are a way to go through the flow, if it is true do this, if not, move to the next statement to see if it's true. 
Types of if statements:
- if, else
- if, elseif, else


5. Boolean values (true, false) - boolean is essentially two choices, true or false.
