1) Variables are used to store and hold values which can be strings, numbers, and many other data types.

2) Strings are blocks of text that is wrapped with single or double quoutes. Any text that has quotes around it is a string.

3) Functions are used to perform tasks and calculate values. We can pass in arguments when calling functions that matches a definition of the variable names we declared in the parenthesis when we declared our function which are called parameters. We use the return statement to stop execution of a function and return us the value within the function. It's the only way for data to escape from a function. Whatever is being returned can only be accessed within the function the return statement is in. No code after a return statement will be executed and the function will stop running the code right after the return statement is executed.

4) If statements are used to evaluate if a certain condition is true or false. If a condition inside the first statement is true the code inside the first block will run. If it's not true it will go onto the next if/else statement if there exists one and see if that condition is true. If neither conditions are true it will eventually evaluate to false.

5) Boolean values are values that tell us if something is true or false. We only have two choices with boolean values, on or off, yes or no, 0 or 1, and of course true or false.
