    a) A variable is giving something some space and a name so that you can change it and bring it back again later.
    b) Strings are groups of text such as a word or a bunch of letters meant to be kept together.
    c) Functions are a group of instructions that tell the computer to do something with the variables you made. You give the function an argument to tell it what to use and then it returns something back out once it is done.
    d) If statements tell the computer to do something only if this thing you tell them to check is true, otherwise they don't do what you told them to.
    e) Boolean values can either be two things: true or false.
