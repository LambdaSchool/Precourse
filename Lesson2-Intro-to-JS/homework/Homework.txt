Variables:
A Variable is a way to represent values in a programming language so that they can be used by the computer 
to represent real world data and objects be them physical or virtual. Examples include the name "John" the object cat, the number 7 or 
any other value you would like to represent. 

Strings
Strings are simply characters such as A-Z or any special characters such a !@#$%^(*&^% including space that when put together
are representative of a word, words, setenses or any other number of said characters include a blank space. 
The characters are stringed together hence the name string

Functions (arguments, return)

A function is like a block that can be used over and over in different parts of code. Write it once and use it over and over. 
The arguments are the values that a function can take. return is what will be given back to the same spot in code that the function was run from at the end of the function. 

if statements
A if statement is a condtional statement such as if dog = bulldog price = 300 else if dog does not equal bulldog dog is not for sale.
It is simply a statment of if this then that or else that. 

Boolean values (true, false)
Boolean values are the computers way of representing a on or off state. 
They are a way to check to see if something only has two possible answers such as yes or no or white or black. 
True usually means 1 and false usually means 0 you can think of these like switches.
is light on yes so switch is up. Is light off no so switch is down. 
another way is to think of them as energized/de-energized.
