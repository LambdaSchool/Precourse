	* Variables
  variables are like those in those in algebra.
  "const" is used to store something that is not meant to be changed
  "let" is used to store something that is meant to be changed

	* Strings
  "string" is a list of characters inside quotations

	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
  functions are used to do something again and again. It just needs to be called by it's name. There are some that don't have a name, but they can still be called in other ways. Like if I look at you and tell you I am hungry without saying you're name, you still know I'm talking to you because I am looking at you. 

	* `if` statements
  if statements are used to control the flow of a program. For example, "If" you're thirsty, drink water. If you're hungry, eat food. If you're not hungry or thirsty, keep doing whatever you're doing.

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
  Boolean values are used to to help with the flow of a program. If it's "true" that your're thirstry, drink water. If it's "true" that your're hungry, eat food. If it's false that you're hungry or thirsty, keep doing whatever you're doing.
