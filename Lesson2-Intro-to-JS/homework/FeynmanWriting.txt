Feyman Writing Prompts

Variables
    Variables are any a way for me to store a value of anything I want to use later. 
    I can store numbers or text in a variable and use that data to recall later in a function 
    or whatever else I am trying to do with my code.

Strings
    Strings are always going to be used to store text, whether it's one word or many.

Functions
    Functions tell the computer to perform a certain task using a combination of strings and variables.
    Once the function is built, it can be recalled many times within the same program.
    It is essentially a shortcut to a more complicated task that, once built, makes it easier to recall.

if statements
    If statements are contained within functions. They tell the computer to perform a certain task 
    if a condition is met.
    If the condition is not met, then a separate task is completed.

Boolean Values
    Can either be true or false. They tell the computer to compare two or more things and return 
    whether the value is true or not.
