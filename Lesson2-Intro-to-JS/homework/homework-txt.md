1) Variables are used to store and hold data. We can think of them like a box that has a name tag in front of it that describes what values are contained inside the box.

2) Strings are blocks of text wrapped in double or single quotes.

3) Functions are used to perform a task or to calculate values. We can pass them parameters for when we call them we invoke arguments into them so it returns us the encapsulated parameters inside the scope of the function. Arguments are just what we put in the parenthesis when we're calling a function. The return statement is used to return us a value within a function. Any code after the return statement will not execute and we will have only the value after the return statement.

4) If statements are used to evaluate if a certain condition is true or false.

5) Boolean values are used to give us a YES or NO, ON or OFF answer. They are returned within if statements, returned when we're comparing numbers to each other and other comparisons. It can also return true or false in many other conditions.
