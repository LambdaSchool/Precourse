* Callback Functions
callback functions are a functions passed as arguments to others functions

	* arguments
arguments are the data we pass to function like the calculator to do addition
 we need two value thats the arguments is like an array with only .length method to see 
 how many arguments we pass to the function.
	* prototype
    prototype is like ben said in real life like mecanique shop we dont ship all 
    the materiel to the client, he come to the garage , cars are object and prototype is 
    the garage and the equipements, Each class has a prototype property.
    
	* Constructors
    object is too limiting in many situations. We need a way to create an object "type" 
    that can be used multiple times without having to redefine the object every time 
    to meet each particular instance's needs the standard way to achieve this
     is to use the Object Constructor function.
     an object Constructor is a javascript function.
