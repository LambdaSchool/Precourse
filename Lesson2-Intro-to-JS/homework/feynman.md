  * Variables
      Variables are like buckets. Whatever you put in the bucket becomes that variable. 
	* Strings
      Strings are a collection of numbers and letters
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
      Functions are like recipes. We use functions so that we don't have to write the recipes over and over every time we want to bake with that recipe.
	* `if` statements
      If statements are choices. Forks in the road. Telling us what we need to do, depending on what the circumstance is.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
      A statement is either true or false. Boolean values identify whether something should be true or false based on what it is claiming to be.
