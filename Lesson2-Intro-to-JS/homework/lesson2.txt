Variables

A variable is a name which refers to some object in a program -- a number,
a boolean value, a string, a function, etc.  Variables can either be
constant (unable to change their value), created with the const keyword as such:

    const myName = 'Joe';

or can be literally variable if they are created with the let keyword:

    let x = 5;
    x = x + 1;


Strings

A string is a sequence of characters.  A string literal value is written
in a program by enclosing it in single or double quotes like so: 'abc12de'


Functions (arguments, return)

A function is a named block of code which can be reused by calling it from
elsewhere in a program.  A function can receive arguments - values passed
to it when it is called, and can return a value back, like so:

    function max(a, b) {
        if (a >= b) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return b;
        }
    }

    let maxVal = max(5, -10);


if statements

An if statement is program construct which allows the program flow
to conditionally execute a block of code, as follows:

    if (value < 0) {
        // only done if value is negative
        doSomeStuff();
    }

    // continue with program flow
    alwaysDoThisStuff();


Boolean values (true, false)

A boolean value is a logical value of either true or false.  Boolean
variables can be useful when used in conjunction with if statements
or other conditional statements:

    let isNegative = (x < 0);

    if (isNegative) {
        doStuff();
    }
