    Homework: 1

	Variables: A named thing stored in memory that has other information stored in it -- a variable can be a letter, a
	number, a word, a collection of those, an array, a booleon, an object, or function -- variables can be unchangeable
	-- in the case of a constant (const), or can be changed 'let' variable. 

	Strings: A collection of characters, alphabetic or numeric, used typically to display information to the client.
	Strings cannot be used for direct mathematic computations. 

	Functions: A function is a group of reusable code that can be called on from anywhere in your program. A parameter
	is a specific variable that is placed inside and used in the function, and the return statement is the value that is
	returned from the completed function calculation. 

	If Statement is a conditional statement where if the first prerequisite happens, then something inside the if
	statement happens -- this can be coupled with if/else, as in if there's not the first thing, then the other thing
	happens, or even chained with if/else if/else statements, where there are multiple different potential paths.  

	Boolean values, are binary values that are either true or false, default for a variable is true -- 0 defaults to
	false, 1 defaults to true. Comparison statements (like 1 === 0, which is false) are valid.
