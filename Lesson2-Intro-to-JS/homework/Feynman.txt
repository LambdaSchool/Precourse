1. Variable - They are the container that your data values in programs are stored. Your data values would be 
              considered your toys, and the variables would be the toy chest you store them in when done.
2. Strings - Strings are used to store sentences or words. Example "Your Name Here."
3. Functions (arguments, return) - Functions are used to complete a certain task assigned. Arguments are the values
                                   the function receives when it's being used. Return will give the results of the 
                                   function when it has completed.
4. If statement - You use an if statement if you want a condition to be executed when true. So if I said if it's 
                  raining, return true, if it's not raining, return false.
5. Boolean values - These values are only true or false, it'd be like if I asked you a yes or no question. One value
                    would be true, and the other false.
