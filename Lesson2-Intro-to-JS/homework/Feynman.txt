1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables - Variables are memory locations that the program has access to. These memory locations can hold values from primitive data types or references to other memory locations.
	* Strings - Strings are sequences of characters. They can be either primitive data types or objects, based on the programming language that is implementing them.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) - A function is a sequence of code that can be called repeatedly. This is useful, because it allows programs to become more modular and portable. Arguments are what a function accepts, they can be thought of as inputs for the mathematical concept of a function. The return value can be thought of as the mathematical output of a function, however, a return is not required; in the instance of a return not occurring, yet a function still performing calculations, then the function is usually classified as a sub-routine.
	* `if` statements - If statements are control structures that allow for a program's sequence of execution to branch off into different directions. This is useful for when a program has to decide to take a step out of various, possible steps.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - Boolean values are named after a mathematician, if I remember correctly, who discovered them. Boolean values are a dichotomy of true or false, if they hold a value other than the equivalent of null. Boolean values are useful for the aforementioned if statements, because they provide the conditions upon which if statements decide where to branch off onto.
