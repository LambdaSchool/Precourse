Variables
Variables are like containers. They hold certain types of data, and can change what types of data they hold. You name a variable to be able to use the data it holds later on. 

Strings
Strings are a type of data that can be represented by text, like a word or a sentence. They must be surrounded by single or double quotes.  

Functions (arguments, return)
A function is like math. It packages up code into a block that can be used over and over. We use arguments in functions to tell the code how to act. We can return the results to show it on screen. 

if statements
If statements tell a function how to act when they see a certain argument. If the function doesn't see that argument, it doesn't act or does something else. 

Boolean values (true, false)
Booleans are data types that can only be one of two values, such as true/false, yes/no, on/off.
