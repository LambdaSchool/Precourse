1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Explain Variables
    /*  
        A variable is a way to store a value that you can use later.
        Different ways to declare a variable.

        var age = "30";
        let gender = "Male";
        const Country = "Sweden";
    */


	* Strings
    /*
        All text with quotation marks around them are Strings.
        And contain blocks of text. 
    */


	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
    /*
        Functions compute variables and change them.
        You give functions names depending on what they do.
        Different ways to declare a function

        function getFistName() {}
        let getLastName = function () {}
        let getAge = () => {}

    */

	* `if` statements
    /*
        if statements is a way for functions to check if something is true or false
        and continue to run the code if it's true or skipping if it's not.
    
    */


	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

    /*
        Boolean comes from low level computer sience and is a way 
        for the code to mean if something is true or false.

    */
