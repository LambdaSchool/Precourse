Variables: Something that is assigned to anything you want.

Strings: An arrangement of letters or numbers inside a pair of quotes. A string can also contain spaces.

Functions (arguments, return): A set of directions to specifically follow. Certain things (arguments) can be told to follow the directions.
Once the set of directions is completed, the end result can be shown if desired (return).

if statements: A way to check if the answer to a question is right or wrong and then carry out a certain set of directions after we know
if the answer is right or wrong. If the answer is right ,a certain set of directions will be done. If the answer
is wrong, a different set of directions will be done.

Boolean values (true, false): These can be thought of as an "off/on" switch to check if the answer to a question is right. If the answer is right,
then the switch will be turned on (true), if not, the switch will be turned off (false).
