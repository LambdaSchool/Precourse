Variables in programming are ways that a computer knows where to store information.  One simple way to think of a variable is to think of a variable like a 
dresser in your bedroom.  The dresser has different drawers that hold different objects (socks, shirts, pants, ect.).  A variable is similar to one of the 
drawers.  If you have many different drawers you might label them based off what is inside.  The variable name (or label on the drawer) isn't what is in the 
drawer it just simply labels it to easily locate what you are looking for.  The variable itself is what holds the information (like the drawers holds your clothes), 
and these variables come in different types.

One type of variable is called a string.  A string is a closed set of text enclosed by quotation marks such as a name (i.e. "Justin", "Car", "Happy Birthday!").

Functions are ways for programmers to run "mini" programs inside of a program.  These functions can be simply thought of as an equation in math.  If you are given the 
numbers 2 and 8 and want to know what they add up to, you simply add and get the answer of 10.  A function acts the same way, give the function an input variable(s) 
(such as a number(s), 2 and 8) and based on what the function is intended to do (addition), will give you some kind of answer (in this case 10).  

A common question somebody asks themselves often begins with "If I ________ , than _________" (i.e. "If I throw my pencil at my teacher, than I'll get in trouble").
Well in programming, if is a very important idea.  Using an if statement allows programmers to tell the computer if a certain condition is met, then I want this to happen.

Thinking back about variables and their different types, we know numbers and strings (blocks of text).  But another type of variable is known as "boolean".
Boolean is neither a number (5, 1000, ect.) or a string ("Hello World!"), but is instead only equal to one of two values: True or False.
