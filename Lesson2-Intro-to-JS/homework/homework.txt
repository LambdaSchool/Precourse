Feynman Writing Prompts

In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following
concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you
quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

Variables:

Sometimes you want to keep track of some information, maybe something that will
change. For example, you could use a variable called 'bank_balance' to keep
track of how much money you have in your bank as the amount goes up and down.

Strings:

A string is a sequence of letters. Any block of text is a string, basically.

Functions:

Sometimes you want to be able to use a bunch of instructions over and over.
Instead of writing those instructions over and over, you can abbreviate them.
You do this by making a function, which is like a name for a whole series of
instructions.

'if' statements:

Sometimes you want the program to do something if some condition is met. For
example, maybe you want the program to buy something from Amazon, *if* you have
enough money in 'bank_balance'. So you can use an if statement to check if you
have enough money, and then buy the thing if you do, and do nothing (or
something else, like send you a warning) if you don't.

Boolean values:

Boolean variables are a type of variable. Use these if you want to store some
information that can only be one of two things, true or false. Maybe I don't
want to store the amount of money I have, for example, but only if it is enough
for some task. You could store that information in a boolean variable: it would
be true if you have enough, false otherwise. The 'true' and 'false' are the
actual Boolean values---the kind of thing you'd store in those kinds of
variables.
