	* `if` statements: if statement is a testing statement which tests for some certain conditions to be true and if true runs a block of code. This statement helps in articulating logic in a program. If condition is true run the block of code else it doesnot run.

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`): Boolean values consists of only two values, either true or false. Such values are similar to a switch which has only two states. It can be on or off.
