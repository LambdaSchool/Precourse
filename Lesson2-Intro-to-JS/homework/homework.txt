Variables:
    Variables in the computer programming are similar to buskets. The buskets represent a container where you can store values
    or replace them with new values.

Strings: 
    Strings are sequence of characters. For instance 'Hello World' is a string with 11 characters. 
    You can join two strings and produce new string. You remove some part of string. 

Functions:
    Functions are programming tools that you can use to simplify your repeated tasks. For instance, 
    you can create a function that computes a value given inputs. Then, you can use same function repeadetly to
    compute output for different values of inputs.

If:
    If statements are logic controls in programming. 

Boolen values:
    Boolen values can simply take true or false. You can use boolen values as an input for if staements.
