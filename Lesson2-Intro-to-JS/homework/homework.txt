Variables are data set to strings. I.E. a = "cat" the string would be Cat and the variable would be a which in use would give you cat.
let is used for variables that can potentially be changed.
const is used for variables which remain constant.

Strings are the blocks of text.

Function is a formula intended for use later.

if statements are used to perform an action IF it meets the requirements.

boolean values are just true or false. You can have things equal to something which would be either true or false.
