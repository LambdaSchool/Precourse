	Feynmann Writing Prompts:
    * Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

    *Variables* are how programming languages store values (strings, numbers, boolean) for later use.
    *Strings* are blocks of texts designated by single or double quotations.
    *Functions* are how programing languages manipulate input variables and output return variables.
    *IF statements* compare two variables using comparison operators. If the comparison is true one set of code is run, otherwise another set of code is run. Paths are mutially exclusive.
    *Boolean values* are variables with only two possible values, true or false.
