    * Variables - Container that holds different types of content (strings, integers, float, array, objects, etc.)
	* Strings - A list of characters 'this is a string'
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) - Arguments are variables that are passed into a function.  The `return` statement is what is returned when the function is called.  A `return` statement will end the function and continue your code after the final } that ends the function.
	* `if` statements - A block of code that will run if the statement evaluates to be true.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - When evaluating statements, code will return a true (yes) or false (no)
