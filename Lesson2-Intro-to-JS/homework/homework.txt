# Homework: Lesson 1

#### Variables

Variables are like mailboxes that can hold information for later use. If we
want the variable called ```name``` to store the word ```adam``` it is like
writing the word on a piece of paper and putting it in the mailbox to retrieve
later on

#### Strings 

A string is a series of characters. ```adam``` is a string, as is
```asdfgqw£$$%£r```. 

#### Functions

A function is a block of code that does a job for us, then gives us back
a result. This block can be reused whenever we call it and will always do the
same job. A function can take arguments which is like giving it some
information we want it to process or work with. It gives us back the result
when we use the ```return``` keyword

#### If statements

An if statement is like a fork in the road. We can choose to go down one path,
or another. The choice decides if one or another piece of code runs before
joining back up to the main path to continue running


#### Boolean values

A boolean value can either be 'on' or 'off'. We call this ```true``` and
```false```. Just like a light switch is either on or off.
