	* Variables
    Variables are a way to store the value of 
    something to reference later. You create
    a variable by first using a keyword and 
    then defining what value you want it to
    reference. There are three ways to begin
    a variable. One is var, which is an older
    way of doing it. Then there is let, which
    defines it for a smaller amount of code.
    Then there is const, short for constant,
    if you want to continue to use the variable
    throughout your entire code.
	* Strings
    Strings are letters and words. If there are
    letters or words with quotes around them, 
    that is a string.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
    Functions take the stored values/variables
    and do something with them. It could be 
    computing a math problem, or change a word,
    or combine two words. There are three ways 
    to create a function.
	* `if` statements
    If statements allow you to cause a scenario
    to occur if another scenario occurs. It's 
    like if you tell someone "If you give me
    twenty dollars, I'll give you twenty bananas".
    Except in this case, it's data from the code.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
    Boolean values give you only two choices,
    true or false. It is black and white, all
    or nothing, yes or no. This is also a great
    use case for an if statement. If something is
    true, this will happen. If not, it won't.
