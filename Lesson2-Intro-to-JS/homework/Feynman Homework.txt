Variables
A variable is a way of giving another name to an object and storing it. If you have a bunch of data, but
don't want to type that data out every time you need to refer to it you can just assign it to a variable instead. 


Strings

A string is just text with quotations around it. It can contain letters, numbers, and special
characters, but it is only a string if it has quotations around it.


Functions(arguments, return)

A function is a set of instuctions that produces a result. An argument is data you put inside of the function
for it to change or add to. Return stops the functions and sends out the result, it is the only way for data to
escape the function. Functions can access data outside of them, but the data is inaccessable outside the funcition
unless it is returned.


If statements

If statements check if something is true and return a value if it is, if it isnt true then it will continue down
the function until it is and return something else.


Boolean Values(true, false)

Boolean values(bools) can only be either true or false. They are commonly used in if statements.
