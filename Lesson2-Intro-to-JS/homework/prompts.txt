1. What is a variable?

A variable is like a shortcut to a value. They can be thought of as tentacles because multiple variables can attach to the same value.

2. What is a string?

A string is a collection of characters surround by quotes. Wrapping the text in quotes ensures that it's just text, and not a command for the programming language.

3. What is a function, arguments, and return?

A function is just a set of instructions that are grouped together. Arguments of a function are pieces that are supplied from outside of it. For example, adding is a function call, and the numbers you're adding together can be thought of as arguments. The return statement is what the function gives back to you after it's completed.

4. What is an if statement? 

If statements are like questions. For example, when you get dressed in the morning, you make a lot of decisions in the morning. When it's cold outside, you put a jacket on. When it's hot, you leave the jacket and put on shorts. This is an example of if statements at a basic level. If it's cold outside, put on a jacket. If it's hot outside, put on some shorts and leave the jacket.

5. Explain boolean values.

Boolean values amount to yes or no. Is three less than one? No, so it's false. Is my name Andrew? Yes, so it's true.
