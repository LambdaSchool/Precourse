Variable: a way to store data for later use. Think of it like a little box you can put stuff into, like numbers and words.
let num = 3;
let word = "hello";

String: data surrounded by quotation marks, usually comprised of alphanumeric characters. 
let word = "hello";

Functions: instructions for the program to do something
function doSomething() {
	// do some stuff in here
}
	Arguments: data that is passed (given) to the function to have stuff done to it.
	Arguments go into the () after 'function.'
	function doSomething (rate, time) {
		// do something with rate and time
	}
	return is data that a function might spit out when it's finished with the instructions
	function doSomething (rate, time) {
		// get a value back from some math
		return rate * time;
	}

if-statement: one type of conditional that helps control data flow. Think of it like a fork in the road. If <something>, then <something else>. If your room is clean, then you can go outside.
if (roomIsClean) {
	goOutside();
}

Boolean values (true, false): boolean values can be one of two states - true or false. They are often used with if-statements. They are used for a number of operations, including:
	On or off
	Yes or no
	1 or 0
if (roomIsClean === true) {
	goOutside();
}
