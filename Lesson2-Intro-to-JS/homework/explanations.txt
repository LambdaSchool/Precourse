Variables - JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
            JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
            JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
            Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

Strings - JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
          A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

Functions - A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
            A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Conditional Statements - Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
                         Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
                         Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
                         Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

Boolean Values - A Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.
