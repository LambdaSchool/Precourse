Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Variables
Strings
Functions (arguments, return)
if statements
Boolean values (true, false)

Variables -Variables are like nicknames, nicknames are usually a short and easy way to refer to someone or something that others understand

Functions - Functions take an input (argument) and output something. Imagine a gumball machine,
you input a quarter and then it randomly releases a gumball from the machine

if statements - when something is the case you are told to do something else
most of your day you are running an bodily if statement. if you need to use the bathroom, you go to the bathroom,
otherwise continue doing what you are doing

Strings - strings are a single or set of characters like letters or numbers strung together in a line, your name is a string of letters

Boolean values - nodding your head is usually a way we signal that we agree that something is true
shaking your head is usually a way that we signal that we disagree or that something is false
