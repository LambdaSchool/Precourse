Variables: When we use the term "variables" we are talking about a name 
for a value.  Sort of like here is a name like "x" or "name" or 
"squigglePus" and I will give or ASSIGN that name a value.  We use the 
equals sign to do the assigning.  So we assing x the vaule of 6...x=6.  
So the left side represents the right side.  

Strings: A string is something on the right side of the assigning 
function.  It is encased in parentheses so we know it is a string.  It 
can be any combination of characters...it can be a word, a sentence, a 
paragraph, or just one character.  Being a string, there are certain 
ways we can work with the vaule, it has special properties that other 
types do not have.

Functions: functions are mini-programs that do some little thing over 
and over at will.  Functions take arguments. Arguments are the starting 
values or substrate that we are going to run the process on.  Return is 
what the function generates when we run the mini-program on the 
arguments we started with.

if statements:  if statements let us run a little function over and over 
but also allows us to set the beginning and end point of it running, 
usually by specifying what the range of arguments we will use.  We can 
have it run only IF some condition is met.

Boolean values(true, false): Bools are a way of saying yes/no, on/off, 
zero/one.  so if something can be explained with two states, either/or 
we can use a bool to set or check which one that is.
