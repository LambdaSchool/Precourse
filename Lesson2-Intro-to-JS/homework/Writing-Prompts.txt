WHAT IS....

1. Variables
    A variable is a like an empty box. You can put whatever you want in it. You have to name it when you put something in it.

2. Strings
    A string is the letters, words, or text you want other people to see or read.

3. Functions (arguments, return)
    A function is like a remote control. It does the magic.
    The function will do whatever you press on the remote.
   
    Arguments are what you press/ the keys on the remote. 
    A return is what you see on TV once you press a remote key.

4. if statements
    An if statement is like choosing which fruit to eat. Choosing one would give you a specific taste of the fruit you chose. If you choose an apple, it would taste like an apple.

5. Boolean values (true, false)
    Boolean values are similar to yes or no and correct or incorrect. You are only given two choices when answering. Like a closed-ended question.
