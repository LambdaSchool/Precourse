1. A variable is like a storage bin. You can store things inside it and put a dscriptive label on it to help you remember
    what's inside it. JavaScript doesn't really care what kinds of things you put inside the bin. You can declare a variable
    using var, let or const.

2. A string is just some text that's wrapped in quotes i.e. "Hello World" or "JS is cool!." You can also treat a string as
    an array of characters using bracket notation. JavaScript provides helpful built-in string properties such as length, as
    well as methods such as replace, trim and substring.
    
3. You can think of a function like a person you hire to do a task for you. For example, you could tell the person to clean
    a room in your house (in JS, you would write a cleanRoom function) and you'd wait on the person to do that before resuming your task.
    You can also pass arguments to a function. This would be like specifying what time you'd like the room cleaned or which room
    should be cleaned. Finally, functions can return a value to their caller. This would be like telling the person you hire to
    go out and get your car washed and then drive it back to you. So the carWash function would take a dirty car as input and return
    a clean car as output.
    
4. If statements simply check whether the program should do one thing or the other based on some condition. For example, if it
    is sunny and warm outside, I'll take a run. Otherwise, I'll exercise indoors.
    
5. Boolean values are only true and false (or something that evaluates to one of those two).
