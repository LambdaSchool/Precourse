# Feynman Writing Prompts

## Instructions
In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)


### Variables
Variables are ways of storing information. It's like a label that points to something. That something could be a number, some text, or other pieces of information.

To make a variable, you first start with a special word called const. Then you add your label. Then you point your label to the piece of information. If you want to store a phone number, for example, it could look like this:

const phoneNumber = 1111111;

### Strings
Strings are blocks of text, like a name, sentence, or even a whole story! To tell the computer that you're writing a string, you add a single quote ' at the front and back of the string '. Just like if someone in a story were talking - there's quotes around what they're saying.

### Functions
Functions are like little machines. You put something in, it does some work, and you get something different out. The thing you put in is called an 'argument'; it's like the coin you put in a vending machine. When the function has done its work, it needs to give you the finished product. This is done by using the word 'return'. Return tells the function to give back the result of its work - like that can of Coke.

### 'if' statements
An 'if' statement is like a branch in a tree. One branch goes one direction and the other branch goes another direction. Both sprout leaves and new branches. 'if' statements are used when you want the computer to do something (or many things) based on the answer to a question. The computer reaches your 'if' statement, does a calculation, then follows a 'branch' to the end.

### Boolean values
Boolean values are like our morals - they tell us what's right ('true') and what's wrong ('false'). For example, if you are 12 years old and I said you were 20 years old, you would say 'false!'. In JavaScript, booleans are our moral compass - they tell us what's true and what's not.
