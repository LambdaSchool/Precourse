Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Variables:

At the heart of Javascript are variables. A variable is a way to store the value of something to use later. (A note for those with previous programming knowledge: Javascript is a loosely typed language, a variable can be set (and reset) to any type, we do not need to declare its type when initiating the variable.)

The anatomy of a variable is first the keyword, a space, the name we are giving the variable, an equal sign, the value we are assigning the variable and then the semi-colon.

Strings:

A string is a block of text, with quotes around it. 

Functions (arguments, return):

A way of using the same code, over and over, with different arguments. 

if statements:

a way to branch off results of a function. If its this result, return this. However, if its this other result, return this. So on and so forth. 

Boolean values (true, false):

A yes or no, true or false, on or off value. In JS this is true or false.
