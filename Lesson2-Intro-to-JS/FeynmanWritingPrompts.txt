- Variables - 
	Variables are containers that hold data.  Variables can hold values such as text, numbers, and booleans. 
	There are three types of variables used in JavaScript.  These are var, let, and const.  var is the generic
	variable type.  let variables can be changed although they have block level scope.   const variables cannot
	be changed once they are created.


- Strings - 
	Strings are groups of text that must begin and end with either a single or double quotation.


- Functions (arguments, return) - 
	Functions are a small group of code that performs a task.  The function begins by passing an argument. Once
	an argument is passed, it is time to return something back.  Only things returned from the funcion can be 
	used outside of the function and the function stops running after the first return.


- if statements - 
	if statements are blocks of code that only activate if the result is true.  else or else if statements can be
	used along with if statements to control the situation and results better.


- Boolean values (true, false) - 
	 Boolean values are simple logic decisions where the only two choices are true or false.
