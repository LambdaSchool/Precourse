Feynman Writing Prompts

Variables:
Variables are like containers where you can store information that you can use later.

Strings:
Strings are blocks of text that have either singe or double quotation marks around them.
Strings can be used as a type of variable.

Functions:
Function take variables and do compute, change, or do something to the variables.
variables that are passed into the function are called "arguments". arguments usually
go into the parenthesis right after the function name after the function statement.
To process the computation or changes made by the function you would create a "return"
statement. Return statements stop the function to compute what is written in the function
and allows you to access something inside the function.

if Statements:
if Statements are functions that allow you to access different return values depending
on if certain conditions are met within the if Statement.  For example, you could
have the function return different things depending on whether one variable is greater
than another depending on the arguments passed to those variables.

Boolean values:
Boolean values are true or false, on or off, 1 or 0.  Boolean values are often used
like a switch or toggle.
