	* Arrays
    Are a series of variables grouped into a larger container.
    Each space in the container has a unique position (an index), 
    and the length of the object is known.
    You can loop through each element. pop will take an item off the 
    end, while push will insert one. Unshift will add an item to the 
    beginning, while shift will remove one.
