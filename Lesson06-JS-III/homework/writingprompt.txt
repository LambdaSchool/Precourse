Arrays:

An array in programming could very easily be compared to a paper grocery list.
With only a couple weird rules to follow, array's arent too much to sweat. 
Each item in the grocery list has a placement on the array 'groceryList'.
except the first item isn't the first, it's the 0-ith! What that means is that
the first item is alwayse at the position of '0' in an array, and the second
item has a position of '1' and the third a position of '2' etc.. So a REALLY 
easy way to remember that is to look at an array, see which item it is and just
subract 1 before trying to use it.

Array's are extrememly common and you'll get used to them extrememly quickly 
after playing around with them.
