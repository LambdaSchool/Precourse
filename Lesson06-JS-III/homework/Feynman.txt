Explain the following concepts as though you are explaining them to a 12-year-old
person:

ARRAYS
An array is a group of data, such as strings, integers or booleans. For example,
we might want to store the names of the kids in your class in a single variable.
To do that, we'd create an array, and it might look something like this:

const namesOfStudents = ['Susan', 'Sophie', 'Sarah']

With that variable, we can access all of the names of the students in your
class. If you want to retrieve a single name, we can tell the computer to give
us an item in the array by using its index. The index is just the position of
the item in the array, just like counting. We start counting at zero ('Susan'),
then one ('Sophie'), and onward. So if we want to retrieve, say, 'Sophie' from
the array, in this instance we'd enter namesOfStudents[1].

If there is a new kid in your class, we can add their name by using the .push()
or .unshift() functions. If a kid leaves the class because they move away, we
can remove their names from the array by using the .pop() or .shift() methods.

For loops are handy for arrays because they allow us to do a repetitive action
over each of the items in the array.
