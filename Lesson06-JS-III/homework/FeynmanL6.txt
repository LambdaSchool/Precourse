Arrays - Arrays are containers for items that are separated into their own 'boxes'.  You can think of an array like a compartmentalized storage box.  Each item in the storage box is separate from the other items by being placed in its own box. Each box that holds an item is given a unique identifying label. For an array, this label is limited to numbers and the first box is labelled zero.  The next box would be labelled 1, then the next box labelled 2, and so on.  The items in an array do not have to be the same kind of items, but they probably will be related to each other in some way.  For instance, say you want to store baseball items in a array/container that you name "Baseball Items".  In one box of the array, you may store a baseball glove, in another box a baseball cap, and in another a set of baseball cards.  These items are related to each other, though they aren't the same type of item.  Furthermore, when speaking about arrays in a computer, there are ways that we can immediately retrieve how many items our array contains.  We also have tools that let us 'open the box' to see what an individual box contains, and we can easily add and take away items from our array.
