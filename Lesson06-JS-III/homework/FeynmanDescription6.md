The following are simple descriptions of relevant concepts.

1.) Arrays - Arrays are what we use in computer science to handle groupings of variables. If we have a group of variables that would make sense to lump together, like students in a classroom, for example, we can store their names in an array for easy access. This is in place of creating a variable for each element independently and having to manage all of those variables. An array allows us to loop through and modify, or retrieve all of the items in the array, quickly and easily. An array also allows us to return multiple values from a function in one simple package.
