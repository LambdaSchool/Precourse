An array is a way to hold a bunch of numbers, strings, and even booleans.
Usually if you wanted to create 5 variables we would do this:
let i = 5;
let f = 6;
let g = 4;
let b = 3;
let n = 2;
But with an array we can do this:
const f = [5, 6, 4, 3, 2];
We get the value we want from an array by order, starting at 0.
f[0] we would get 5.
f[1] we would get 6.
f[2] we would get 4.
etc...

You can also put strings and booleans inside with numbers but usually we want to keep them seperated into there own array.
