                    One's favorite food is often difficult to quantify. There are so many different categories to choose from, each with it's own unique entries and qualities. Does one choose what one finds most delicious, or perhaps the food that one would most like to have an infinite supply of?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I do find it difficult to articulate the process for choosing my favorite food, I can say without equivocation that my favorite food is undoubtedly texas-style BBQ. More specifically, the savory, juicy, smokey concoction known as 'burnt ends', or the most wonderfully flavorful parts of a smoked brisket, cut from the point. Unfortunately, getting your hands on an authentic, quality burnt end is no easy task. In fact, many a BBQ chef refuses to sell them and eats them him/herself!

                    Although I've eaten BBQ in places from Portland Oregon to Las Vegas to Narraganssett, by far the finest BBQ I've ever had was in Austin, Tx at a place called <a href="https://www.labarbecue.com/">laBarbecue</a>. The meats have a thick, wonderful smoke ring and a beautiful black bark. But don't let that fool you into thinking their meats are overcooked. To the contrary, Every bite you take from their amazing selection of smoked meats is moist, flavorful, and delightfully smokey. Although you have your choice of sauces with which to pair your meats, there is no need for any sauces whatsoever. Although their menu does not officially list the burnt ends as an option, if you speak to the chef directly and ask nicely, you will indeed get your hands on some of the smokey deliciousness you crave.
