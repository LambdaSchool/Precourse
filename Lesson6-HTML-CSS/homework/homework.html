I've told them that, they too, can make a nice stew of beans using canned beans, but they'll never let me live down the fact that I was taught to make these beans by buying them by the bag, having them soak for eternity, place them in fresh water over an open flame, add every spice known to man plus a potato, and finally have that bad boy simmer for an extra 1-1.5 hours you'll never get back.</span>
