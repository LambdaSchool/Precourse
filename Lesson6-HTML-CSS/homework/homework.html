        I never met a chocolate I didn't like... It's not just a matter of
        taste. It's the whole experience. First of all, you have to spoon the
        fudge around the rim, leaving only the ice cream in the middle. Then,
        you gently spoon the ice cream around the sides, like you're sculpting
        it. Relish every bite; make every one an event. And then, with the last
        spoonful, close your eyes.... Chocolate is a serious thing.
