                    A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of the meat patty,4
                     but the burger can include many variations in structure, ingredients, and composition. The cheese is normally added to the
                      cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving, which allows the cheese to melt. As with other hamburgers, a cheeseburger 
                      may include toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, or bacon; examples of less common 
                      toppings might be spinach or olives.

                    In fast food restaurants, the cheese used is normally processed cheese, but essentially any other melt-able cheeses may be 
                    used instead -- common examples would include as cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella, blue cheese, and pepper jack. Very soft/wet cheeses 
                    that melt poorly -- like cream cheese, cottage cheese, or ricotta -- are very unusual, and very hard/dry cheeses like
                     Parmigiano-Reggiano (or its imitation, "parmesan") would rarely be used in quantities sufficient to be a recognizable topping as
                      opposed to a seasoning.
