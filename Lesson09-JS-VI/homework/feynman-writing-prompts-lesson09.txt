	* Callback Functions
  Callback functions are called from higher order functions.
  Typically a callback function will help step through arrays, 
  where their common function will be applied to each index. 
  
  A higher order function is basically one function which calls another.
  A higher-order function is a function that can take another function 
  as an argument, or that returns a function as a result.

  Array methods that utilize callbacks include :

  Each steps through an array, applying the callback function to each index. 
  The callback can take two inputs : item, and optionally the index to the item.

  forEach : doesn't have an output

  map : outputs an array
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Another type of array that utilizes callbacks is reduce.
  reduce :  Reduce will step through an array, applying a callback function to 
  each index with the intention of outputing one item. The first input to the
  callback is an total-sum to date, and the second is the current item being 
  processed. The callback must ALWAYS contain a return statement. 
  Reduce also takes an optional second argument, which would be the starting 
  sum.
