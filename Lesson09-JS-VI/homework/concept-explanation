A callback function is passed into another function's argument. It does not get called immediately in the other function but it is called later in the function. It has access of the variables that is in its parent function so it is a closure. An example of using callback functions would be for processing asynchronous operations once it finds the information from the server and returning the information into the callback function, and it can be used for event listeners because it is waiting for the user to click a button or some other input.
