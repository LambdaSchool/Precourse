Callbacks- In javascript we can pass a function as an argument to another function and these functions are called callbacks. They can be called anytime and passed arguments.

A callback must always contain a return statement in it.

Below is an example of a callback where a function is passed as an argument to another function.

function greeting(function(){
return 'Hello, World!';
});
