Callbacks- In javascript we can pass a function as an argument to another function and these functions are called callbacks. They can be called anytime and passed arguments.

A callback must always contain a return statement in it. cb argument variable is used as callback for convention.

Below is an example of a callback.

function incrementsByOne(number){
	return number++;
}

function increment(number, cb) {
 return cb(number);
}

increment(67, incrementsByOne) ;  //68
