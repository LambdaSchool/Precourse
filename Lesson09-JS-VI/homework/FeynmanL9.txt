Callback Functions - A callback function is a special type of function.  It is used whenever we want to give added functionality to another function. The function for which we want to give this added functionality is called the Higher Order Function.  You can think of the higher order function as a base function into which we can provide added functionality.  For the higher order function to take advantage of this new functionality, the callback function is passed into the higher order function via one of its parameters.  An important usage of the callback function is to allow the higher order function to serve more than one purpose and thus keep us from having to duplicate code.  For example, I could have different callback functions that return animal sounds based upon the type of animal.  I could have callback functions named dogSound and catSound. The higher order function has a parameter called 'animalType'. This parameter is set via an argument whenever this higher order function is called.  The higher order function provides some kind of base functionality that is common to all animals.  At some point in the program the function will call one of the callback functions based upon what type of animal it is.  In this way, I can create one higher order function that is flexible enough to be used with all types of animals. I do not have to duplicate the 'base animal' functionality for each type of animal.
