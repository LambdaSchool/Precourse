Callback Functions: Callback's are when you use a variable as a function within
a function. It sounds funky but I like to think of it like spiderman swinging
on webs, because the functions "action" comes to a near halt and then a callback
is used to re-initiate another function or the same one again, instantly going
from one action to another. Most common you'll use this when you need to
continue a function, but have it "function" different, or games or display/
graphical programs.
