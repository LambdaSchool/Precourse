‘Callback Functions’
- Callback functions are pretty sweet - these functions are functions that are passed as an arguments through other functions. Once they are passed into functions, they can be called at any time.

An example of a callback function is shown below:

```javascript
    function saysHelloToUser(user) {
        return 'Hello ' + user + '!';
    }

    function saysGoodbyeToUser(user) {
        return 'Goodbye ' + user + '!';
    }

    function createGreeting(user, cb) {
        return cb(user);
    }

    createGreeting('Dan', saysHelloToUser); // 'Hello Dan!'
    createGreeting('Dan', saysGoodbyeToUser); // 'Goodbye Dan!'
```
In the createGreeting function, we are forced to give two arguments, (1) a name, and (2) a function (a.k.a. our callback function). The createGreeting function then allows us to call the cb function.
