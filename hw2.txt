*Variables

Variables store values which we assign, and they can be modified or 
static, depending on our intentions. We assign a variable in order for
it to be called upon to be used later.


*Strings

Strings are sections of text. We need to confine them within ''


*Functions

Functions store chunks of code, which are directions for how to handle
the variables that we will feed them later. They can be called upon by 
name in order to work those directions over assigned variables for that instance.


*If statements

"If" statements allow for logic branches in your code. This means that
you can assign one set of directions if a certain condition is met, 
otherwise another set of directions is followed.


*Boolean values

This assigns a variable to be either true or false (gives a binary assignment)
