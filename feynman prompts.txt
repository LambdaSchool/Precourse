//Feynman Prompts:
Variables- Are something you are going to give a name to,
to identify it for a later use.  Basically it means that 
that a variable is going to represent something for later use.

Strings- Are a set of characters or words in between quotations like " " or ' '

Functions- are sort of equations, in which you put in variables and then 
it runs that equation to get an output in the form of an action.

if statements-are conditional statements that will execute a block of code if the statement is true.

Boolean values- are a set of binary options, such as yes or no, true or false, and 1 or 0.

for- since most software runs loops, we want them to keep running the function until we find the answer we need or make it
stop when after a number of times. 

&&, ||, !- && means that in order for a statement two be true, both arguments have to be true. || means all a it the program
requires for the statement to be true is to fulfill one or the other argument. ! means the opposite is true. 

Arrays- are a set of data. can be numbers or single strings. 

classes- classes are objects that allow us to share similar properties with each other. 

prototype- is a way for methods to be distributed to every object within a class

callbacks- are functions that are passed into another function as an argument.

closure- is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables and parameter. 

recursion- Recursion is just like for or while loops, except the function calls on itself creating a loop, until we say to stop.
to stop...this case being a false statement instead of a true statement like for loops.
