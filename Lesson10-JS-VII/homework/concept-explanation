A closure is a function that gets returned in another function. Once the outer function gets invoked, the inner function can now be invoked and has access to the values outside of itself. It is great for making customizable functions and keeping variables private from the user so they cannot manipulate it plus it simplifies the programmer's life because the code is not in the global scope. The more variable names in the global scope, the harder it gets to come up with unique variable names and not overwrite the older ones.

Lets say I have a box and there are three numbers outside my box and two numbers inside my box. I can only change the numbers inside my box because they belong to me. I can reference the numbers outside of the box and use them but I cannot change the value of those outside numbers.
