# Homework #JSVII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Closure

Closure is a topic that we start to talk about when we start getting into high order functions, or fuctions that have other functions inside of them. Closure and the concept of scope are closely related, in that a variable created within a function only exists within that function unless it is sent out to something that calls on it using return. If var a is declared outside of a function then it can be used globally. If var a is declared within a function, it can be only used within that function. The same concept also applies to objects, or any sort of nested thing that holds values.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSVII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
