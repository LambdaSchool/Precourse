* Closure the idea of this is that there is a outer function which return inner function definision, and inner function have access to the variables and function declerad inside the outer functoin and to the all variables and function declerad outside of the outer function, but there is no access to inner variables and function from outside of the outer function scope. So the variables and function declerad in the outer function are private. If the name are the same in both scope the inner function will take values from the outer function scope.
