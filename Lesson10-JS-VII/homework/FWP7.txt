Closure: Closure refers to an effect the relationship between global and local scope has. Every function has

it’s own scope, which is the local scope of that function. Anything declared in a function, is generally 
only available in it’s local scope. Things declared outside of functions are generally available in the 

global scope. Closure is effectively a loophole for this rule, which works by taking advantage of the 

rules of scope. A function declared inside of a function, has access to it’s own local scope, and the 

scope of the outside function. Because the inner function can hold the information from the outer 

function, it can work on this information, and then be returned out of the outer function, while

maintaining a link to the information created there. Thus, the inner function has ‘closure’ over the 

scope of the outer variable.
