* Closure: it is a  very powerful concept in JavaScript. It is the case when an function returns a function. The returning function is called the higher-order function, and the returned function will have a memory of the scoop that  it created in. Let say we declare the firstName inside  higher-order function and it returns another function that returns  "lastName + firstName". So when we call the higher Function from outside and we give it the value(argument) of firstName, it will return the small function plus it will give it the value of fistName as well. Therefor,  to get the final result we need to  call the small function and we give it the argument(value) of the lastName only, because it has the value of the firstName already.
