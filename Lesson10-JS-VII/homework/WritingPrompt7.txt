	* Closure


	Closure is the abiility of a function declared in another function to remember the scope it
	was declared in and to access all variables in that scope. In other words the inner function
	has access to all the data in the outer function's scope even after the outer scope was
	executed.

	For example, lets create a function called adder, which takes a number as an argument, and returns
	another function that also takes a number as an argument and returns the sum.

	function makeAdder(x) {
		return function(y) {
			return x + y;
		}
	}

	When we call makeAdder(), we are returned the inner function. We can save this inside a varibale:

		var addTwo = makeAdder();

	Our addTwo variable now holds a reference to the inner function. We can call the inner function like this:

		addTwo(5)(2)

	and the result is the sum of 5 and 2.

	The inner function has closure over the outter function, so the inner function was able to access makeAdder's
	parameter even after makeAdder was executed.
