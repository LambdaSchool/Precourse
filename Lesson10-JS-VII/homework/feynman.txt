Closure in javascript are functions in which fully utilize the scope of variables within a function. A closure
function is put inside of a function and it has access to all of its variables as well as its parameters. This
is useful for when you want to implement specific functions that deal with similar data as a bigger function.
That way the functions inside of the outer function can use all the same parameters and variables and have
an scope of data that allows it to process data seamlessly.
