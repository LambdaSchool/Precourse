Closure - the block of code inside a function, is meaningful in many ways, one of those ways is that it lives in its own little world, called the function scope, also called the local scope. you can think of this as each function block(of code) is its own little house, it can see the outside of it, but the house is also locked in, so other things can't look inside or go inside from the outside. when you have a function within another function, you can think of that as a house within a house, the innermost house can still peek outside to see what is is the outermost house, but the outermost house still can peek inside the innermost house, even though it is inside it, this is what closure is. the local/function scope still applies to function blocks, even if a function is inside another function.
