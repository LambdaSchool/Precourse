- closure // is the idea that when you have a function embedded in another function. The inner function, which is
the function that is inside the outer function, is able to look into the outer function for variables that is
needed. However, this is not true the other way around, the outside function can not call or extract the variable
that is from the inner function. There is also an order in which the functions look towards as well, which is
called the scope chain, the inner function looks one step out first, and then the next function until it reaches
the global scope. The scope is kind of like the environment or layer something is in.
