A closure is created when we use a technique called "currying". Basically it is a meta-function creating other functions. 
The closure contains the information passed into the meta-function and any other logic we define in it. It makes sure the generated function can still access that information even after the meta-function has run out. 

Which is usually not possible - accessing something within the scope of a function after it has run.
