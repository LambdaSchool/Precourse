Variable
A variable is a word, letter, numbers, underscores, dollar signs or some combination of these items
that we use as a placeholder for some other information. 
Defining a variable requires the following elements (make sure to include spaces between each element):
1. A Keyword (var, let, or const)
2. The name you give to the variable
3. An equals sign
4. The information you want the variable to contain 
5. A semicolon (no space needed before this semicolon)

EXAMPLE: let carName = "Hyundai";


Strings
A string stores information in the form of text using quotation marks on either side of the text. 
You can use single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("Hello").
A string can be one word or multiple words. 

EXAMPLE: var carName = "Hyundai Tucson";


Function
Functions perform tasks. These tasks are determined by the coder inside of curly braces as can be seen below. 
Before getting to those curly braces and determining what this function will do, you need to give the function a name. Let's 
say "giveNumber" like this:

function giveNumber

Then you need parantheses to follow without a space after the function like this:

function giveNumber()

Function parameters go inside of those parentheses like this: 

function giveNumber(paramater1, parameter2, ...)
