Variable - A variable is a word, letter, or letter number combination that we use as a placeholder for some other information. 
Defining a variable requires the following elements (make sure to include spaces between each element):
1. A Keyword (var, let, or const)
2. The name you give to the variable
3. An equals sign
4. The information you want the variable to contain 
5. A semicolon (no space needed before this semicolon)

EXAMPLE: let carName = "Hyundai";

Strings - A string stores information in the form of text using quotation marks on either side of the text. 
You can use single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("Hello").
A string can be one word or multiple words. 

EXAMPLE: var carName = "Hyundai Tucson";

Just can't get to the last few.
