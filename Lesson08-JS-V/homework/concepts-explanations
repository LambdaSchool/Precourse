The prototype is an object that all the instances look towards when it does not have the property itself. For example, There is a classified document with codes on it that is in a filing cabinet and there is no other copies except that one. Everyone that works in the office would have to refer to that specific document everytime they needed to know a code. They cannot make copies of it because if it became public then the whole business is ruined. Lets just hope the document does not get shredded or burned.

Constructors are the foundational blueprints in order to make something. For example, if we have a house blueprint for a specific neighborhood, the houses would have the general components like doors, rooms, roofs, and etc. We can make the house different by adding arguments for the number of rooms, square feet, windows and etc.
