PROTOTYPE
You can add a function to a prototype of a class so that you only have to create and store the method for
many objects in one place. Every object of that class will have access to that method while not having to
duplicate memory to store it.

CONSTRUCTORS
Object constructors are like a blueprint telling js some of the properties and methods each object of a
class should have.
