Prototypes: Prototypes can be really funky at first, they light up differnt
colors when you type the word out and its spooky. However, prototype is just
a word used to indirectly work with Objects, more or less 'prototype' is used
to change or interact with an Object.

Constructor: Constructors are used right after you make a class. The next
like of code will often be 'constructor(x,y,z){ this.x = x etc...' Now that
looks kind of intimidating, but all your doing is using constructor to create
the variables that your class needs, and are unique to the class.
