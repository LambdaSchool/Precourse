Feynman Writing Prompts 

Prototype-
When you set your class with a method that renders your prototype. It saves you from recoding your class over and over for multiple entries. 

Constructors-
When you create a new object, a constructor is a method that is called and it initialize the variables/fields of an object. 
A constructor must have the same name as the class its in.
