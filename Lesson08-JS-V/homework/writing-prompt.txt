prototype:
when defining a class, it is best to keep functions that we want this class to have out ouf the class declaration itself, and add them to the prototype of the class.
by doing so, when creating multiple instances of the class, we avoid creating multiple copies of the function (which will always be the same for any instance of the class):
ClassName.prototype.functionName = function() {};

constructors:
after defining a class we can "construct", "create" an instance (object) of that class using the 'new' keyword: var ourNewObject = new Class();
