1. Feynman Writing Prompts- Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12
year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on slack.

- Prototype // This is an extension of an object or class. They allow the class access to a method outside the
class. The primary purpose for this is so we can save computer memory. Everytime a function is made it takes
up space on the computer or server, if we have a function outside of the class where the class can still access
the information, this will greatly save storage space.

-Constructors // Often called class(es), they are a way for JavaScript to access an object template, they are like
objects but allows us to create one "master object" and continually access that information. This is usefull when
we have very similar needs for an object but the information inside needs to be different.
