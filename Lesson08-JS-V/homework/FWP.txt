* `prototype`

Prototype is an object of a class which can store multiple methods defined for that class. Any class object can access these methods, without creating a copy of the method in the object itself, thus saving memory.

* Constructors

Constructors, or class, are templates to create multiple objects that share the same properties and methods.
