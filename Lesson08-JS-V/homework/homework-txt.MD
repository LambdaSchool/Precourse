1) A prototype is a way of setting a method once and objects are able to gain access to the method instead of repeating and rewriting ourselves over and over again building up on the memory and making things slower.

2) Constructors or classes are special functions used to create many objects that share the same properties or methods without having to write long amounts of code. We can simplify our code into constructors and create new objects with a single name defining our object and it will inherit all of the properties that we passed into our constructor.
