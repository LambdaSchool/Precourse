1) Prototypes are a way of setting a method once with a class and giving every object we create with that class access to the methods we create with the prototype property. This makes things simpler by not having to create thousands of class objects repeatedly.

2) Constructors which are also known as classes are like templates or blueprints for us to create multiple objects that share the same properties and methods without having to rewrite and repeat the same properties and methods multiple of times.
