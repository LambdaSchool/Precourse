Variables: Variables are basically labels for something else. You're giving something, anything, a name that you can then use to refer to it by.

Strings: Strings are characters or numbers with quotation marks around them, which your computer thinks is the kind of text that a human would write.

Functions: Functions are like machines, or factories. They take something in, do something to them, and give out a new object.

If statements: If statements decide whether or not something is "true", or fits a requirement you set.

Boolean values: Things that have one of two options. Things like "on" or "off."
