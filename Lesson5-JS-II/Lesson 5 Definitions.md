1. For - For is a loop. It will run the code over and over again until a specified criteria is met. This can be any number of times. Twice, fifty times, or even thousands of times. It can also be an infinite number of times if the criteria is not spefic enough. 
2. && - && is used when needing to know if two statements are true. True will only be returned if both statements are true. If one is true, and one is false, false will be returned. As expected, false will also be returned if both statements are false. 
3. || - || is used when needing to determine if one of two or two statements are true. If either statement is true, true will be returned on the screen. True will also be returned if both statements are true. False will only be returned if both statements are false. 
4. ! - ! means not. It is used just as the word to indicate the opposite of whatever comes after it. For example !=== would mean not equal to, and !> would mean not greater than.
