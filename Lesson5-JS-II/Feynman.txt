Feynman Writing Prompts:

1. 'For' -- It's the keyword for 'For' Loops. It's an object that's already built in to Javascript, like 'If' in If Statements.
2. && -- This is a logical operator that means "And". If both of the expressions are true, this operator will return true. If either or all of them are false, this operator will return false.
3. || -- This is a logical operator that means "Or". If either of the expressions are true, this operator will return true.
4. ! -- This lofical operator means "not". It will simply negate the expressions. For example, '!true' means 'false', and '!false' mewans 'true'. And so on.
