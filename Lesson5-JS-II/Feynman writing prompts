Feynman Writing Prompts:
		
	* `for` Statement:
    Loop that iterates over a variable until it finds a false statement and then it
    will stop the loop (iterations). The syntax and function are divided intothree parts. First a
    variable is declared and a counter iterates over the variable, comparing a conditional
    statement and iterating through the variable until it finds a false evaluation.

	* Logical Operators `&&`, `||`, `!` :
    Logical operators evaluate expressions for Boolean return. The Double Ampersand '&&',
    and the Double Verticle '||', are similar in that the two expressions inside the operators are
    evaluated from left to right.

    Inside the '&&', both expressions inside the operator must be true. Therefore, if the first
    expression is false, the second expression will not be evaluated because both expressions must
    be true for the operator to return true.

    Inside the '||', one, not both of the expressions inside the operator, must be true. Therefore,
    if the first expression inside the operator is true the second expression will not be evaluated
    because only one of the expressions inside the operator must be true for the operator to
    return true.

    The exclamation point '!' is the 'not' operator. When placed in front of an expression, 
    it flips the value of the return to the opposite value. EX: !(true)=false
