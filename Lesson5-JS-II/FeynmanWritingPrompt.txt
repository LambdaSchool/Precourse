Hey again!

Glad you've been learning your Javascript. Here's a note on a few things in Javascript.


Javascript helps the computer make decisions by using many codes. I'll tell you about '&&', '||', and '!'.

When you make a function, you can tell Javascript to check first. For example, if I write.

functionYouGetDessert, I would set it up to check
    if(youDidHomework = true && youAteDinner = true)

Because of the '&&', it will ONLY say you get dessert IF youDidHomework AND you AteDinner. Have to do both before it says true/yes you get dessert.


Let's make it easier for you to get your dessert.

In this function, I'll Write

functionEasyDessert
  if(youDidHomework = true || youAteDinner = true)
  return true

  The "||" means 'or' to Javascript, so you don't have to do both in this function for it to say yes! As long as youDidHomework or youAteDinner, you get your dessert!


Now if you were naughty, you wouldn't get dessert, would you? Take a look below.

FunctionNoDessert
  if(youDidHomework = !true)
return false.

The '!' means 'not'. If you put '!true' that means not true. If you didn't do your homework, you won't get your dessert!



Last thing, in Javascript, there's something called 'for'. What am I telling you this for, you say?

It helps Javascript make decisions by running a function over and over again. It's like if you wanted to find a prime number, you would multiply two numbers over and over again to make sure that number is prime. You would create the for function and set up the logic.

Phew that was a lot. Time for dessert!
