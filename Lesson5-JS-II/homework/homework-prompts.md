# Homework #JSII
## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* `for`
        - Runs a code block so long as what is inside the () is TRUE.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`
        **&&** the code runs if both satements are TRUE
        **||** code runs if at least one statement must be True
        **!** will flip the statements truthiness to the opposite value. (!true) === not true or false

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSII` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
