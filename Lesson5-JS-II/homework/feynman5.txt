Feynman Prompts, Lesson Five

1. 'for' loops:

    'for' loops are a type of conditional loop that will keep running until a certain condition is 
    false. 'for' loops are often used with a counter.

2. &&, ||, and !

    && is a logical operator. It stands for the word 'and'. When && is used, for example inside an if statement, 
    the conditions on both sides of the && have to be true for the entire statement to evaluate to true.

    || stands for 'or'. When || is used, only the condition to one side of it has to be true in order for the 
    whole thing to evaluate to true.

    ! stands for 'not'. It sets the statement to the opposite Boolean value, i.e. if the statement would have 
    originally been true, '!' sets it to false.
