A loop is an expression that evaluates over and over again until it returns what we are looking for or it stops after a certain period of time. The for loop is one of two looping expressions in JavaScript. The for keyword is associated with a for loop expressions. The loop consists of a count variable, a condition state that determines when the loop will stop running (when it returns false), and then finally and increment to our count variable.

&& is a logical operator that returns true if both expressions are true.

|| is a logical operator that returns true if one of the expressions are true.

! is a logical operator will return the opposite of what is passed to it. For example 1 !=== 1 would return false.
