# Homework #JSII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for` = the for loop is a loop you can set to run a set amount of times to run a specific block of code. This can be incremented a number inside a variable or just checking an array. 
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` = && is named "and" and is used on if statements to check if one condition is true AND another one is also true. || is named "Or" and it checks if one condition is true or the other one is true. ! is named "Not" and it checks if a condition is not true. I love how even the name convention sound logical when you read them.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
