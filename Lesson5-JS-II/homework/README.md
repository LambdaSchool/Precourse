# Homework #JSII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for` - This is a syntax used in JavaScript that allows you to create a parameter to run a loop. If you want to display a set of numbers from 10 to 20, you can use a 'for' syntax and set up a loop. You can also use a 'for' loop to display all numbers that are odd or even.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` = these three symbols are logic operators. When you are comparing two things, you cannot use the word "AND" because a computer will not recognize it. Instead you use '&&' (which means 'AND') which allows you to compare. 
	when you are comparing two things and you want to choose one or the other, you will use '||' (which means 'OR').  Lastly, the '!' means 'NOT'. this operator will do the opposite of what is being asked. For example, !false means it is true, and !true means it is false.  

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
