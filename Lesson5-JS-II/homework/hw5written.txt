# for statement
A for loop allows us to test something until a certain condition is reached. 
For instance, if we wanted to know all the numbers that 100 is divisible by ...
We could write a for loop that runs from 0 to 100 and sees which numbers return a remainder of 0


# &&
The double ampersand symbol is used to test whether two statements are both true. 
For instance, if we want to test whether a value is greater than 100, but less than 200 ...
We could use the && symbol
if x > 100 && x < 200 {return true;}
Both statements must be true to return true in this case. For example, 205 is greater than 100 (true), but not less than 200 (false).
The result of testing 205 would then be false since only one of the statements was true.

# ||
The two bar symbol stands for "or" and tests whether one of two statements is true. 
Using the example above:
if x > 100 || x < 200 {return true;}
In this case, the number 205 would evaluate to true, since while it's not less than 200 (false), it is greater than 100 (true) ...
And only one statement needs to be true


# !
The exclamation point is a very simple operator in JavaScript. It simply means "not" or "the opposite of"
So "!true" is false and "!false" is true. 
"!===" means "not equal to.
