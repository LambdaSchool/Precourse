1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for` for is a loop, its like a rollercoaster that continues infinitley until the controller 'a conditional expression' tells it to stop 'false'.  You declare a variable, the seats', then give a conditional expression, 'the tracks', and finally chose how you increment,'the speed', the variable you gave. For loops iterate through the conditions you feed it.

	* `&&`, `||`, `!` - These are logical operators that combine two expressions asking if both are true '&&', one or the other is true '||',  and not '!' true returning the opposite boolean value.
