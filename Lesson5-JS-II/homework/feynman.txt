A for loop is a lot like an if statement in that it asks for certain requirements to be met and then it
execute the functions you ask for it to perform. The difference in a for loop is that you set a variable
and then a limit for the variable. These could be numerical or asking if certain conditions are true or 
false. The computer will then go the code and repeat it until the requirement you asked is met. This could 
be that the code is ran a certain number of times or ran until a certain a variable is true or false.

Logical operaters are there to help you decide if variables you want to check are true of false. Using 
an OR operator, '||', will ask you if one statement or the other is true then run the specific code
you want performed. This will execute the code if even if only of the requirements are met. Ex. If the
variable is greater than 30 or if it as an even number; continue on.

An AND operator, '&&', will ask if all of the statements you included are true then run the specific code.
You can use as many arguments as you want that you want run but they must all be true in order for your
code to run. Ex. If the variable is greater than 30 AND it is lesser than 60; continue on.

An NOT operator, '!' will ask if the statement you included is not true then run the specific code.
This to make sure that if certain things are true then you can run the code. Ex. If the variable is NOT
even; continue on.
