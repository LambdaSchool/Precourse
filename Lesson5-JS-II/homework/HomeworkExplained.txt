Variables - Variables store data. They can be manipulated and changed without hardcoding data more than one time. Variables can be accessed and used as long as it's within it's scope. Variables can be several different types. In Javascript, variables can be integers, float values, strings, booleans, objects, and even functions.
Strings - this is usually data that we'd call words, letters or sentences. It can be manipulated but it cannot be added to integers. If added to integers, it will need to be concatenated, which means that it will just be combined: the text "high" +5; will read high5.
Functions - these are used to perform certain actions to whatever is written within them. They "return" a value which is essentially the "value" of the function once it has been completely executed.
'if' statements - Relatively self explanatory. If one action is true, then execute some code, if that action is false, execute some different code. These can be nested inside each other and used with other logical operators.
Boolean values ('true', 'false') - a binary value that can only be true or false. In Javascript, any variable that holds a value is "truthy" which will return true if compared to a "true" value. Null or Undefined values are false values. Boolean values are the primary way that if statements are evaluated.
