1) for loops are used to repeat conditions a certain amount of times that we want it to repeat instead of writing long amounts of code repeatedly one after the other.

2) && is the and operator. Both sides of this operator has to evaluate to true for the condition to return as a true statement. If one side of the && is a false statement the whole statement will become false. Example 3 === 3 && 1 === 1 will return true while 0 !== 0 && 1 === 1 will return false. || is the or operator. Either side of this operator can evaluate to true and it will return a true statement. For the or operator to return a false statement both sides of the or statement must return false. For example 1 === 1 || 3 === 3 will return true and 1 !== 1 || 3 !== 3 will return false. ! is the not operator. It makes a condition the opposite of its actual value. !true is false and !false is true.
