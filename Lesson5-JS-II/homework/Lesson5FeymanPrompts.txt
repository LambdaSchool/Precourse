1. Feynman Writing Prompts: 
		
	* `for`
        A 'for' loop will continue running its conditional expression until it will become false.  


	* `&&` `||`, `!`
        '&&' stands for And. It needs for both conditions/expressions to be True in order to return True. 

        '||' stands for Or. Only one of the conditions/expressions needs to be True in order to return True. 

        '!' stands for Not and will return the opposite.
