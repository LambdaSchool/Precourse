1. For Loops

For loops repeat a block of code over and over again until a certain condition is met.

2. logical operators

'&&' === AND, will only return true when both statements evaluate as true.
'||' === OR, will return true if either of statements evaluate as true.
'!'  === NOT, will return the opposite boolean value of what is evaluated
