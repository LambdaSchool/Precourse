for is a loop. the proper syntax is for (value for i; condition to be met; i + a further value) {
    function to be ran if condition is met until conditions are not met
}
&& - means the function is testing both conditions and to be true both conditions must be true
|| - means the function is testing both conditions and to be true only one condition has to be true
!- is not. in front of == it means Not Equal to. ! also changes truthiness.
