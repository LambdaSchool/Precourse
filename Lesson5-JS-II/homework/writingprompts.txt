for: for loops use conditional statements. First it will declare a variable like i is 0, then it will look at the next statement so
that as long as i is less than the number 10, it will continue running until it is bigger than it then it stops. After running, the 
loop will execute the last statement which means that it either raises the number by 1 or lowers it depending on the statement.

Logical operators: are used to find out if something is true. In Logical AND (&&), both expressions have to be true for the operator 
to be true and continue running. Logical OR (||), either one of the statements have to be true for it to run. In Logical NOT (!), 
it will return the opposite of the expression that is passed to it. Logical operators also follow order of operations so those in 
parenthesis gets evaluated first and if it occurs first, then it will also get evvaluated first.
