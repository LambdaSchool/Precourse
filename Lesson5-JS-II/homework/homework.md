##For
    'For' creates a loop that starts a number, and either increases or decreases on a loop until a condition is met, while executing the instructions inside.

##'&&', '||', '!'
    && means AND, and requires both statements to be the same for the condition to be true. So 1 == 1 && 1 == 2 are false, even if the first statement is true. '||' means OR, so, either could be true for the condition to be true. '!' means NOT, the condition is the opposite of what the statement evaluates to.
