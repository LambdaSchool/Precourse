* `for`

for is another name for a loop, describing how many times I need to repeat the tasks!


* `&&`, `||`, `!`

&& -  and operator - this weird looking symbol work only when both of the conditions satisfy!
`||` - or operator- works when any of the the condition satisfy
! - not- this does opposite of what its told. if we tell its true it replies with false and vice versa.
