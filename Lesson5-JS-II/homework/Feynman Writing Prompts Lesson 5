If you remmeber in the last lession we talked about comparison operators like greater than (2 > 1), less than or equal to ( 3 <= 6),
etc. Well we also have an interesting comparison operator called the "NOT" (!) and basically it stands for the opposite of something.
For example (!==) means not equal to, and when we write 1 !== 1; this is a false statement because one is equal to 1. Another example
is 1 !== '1'; this turns out to be true because when we use '' it indicates a word or string and not a number.

Now that we know what a comparison operator is we can move onto the logical operators &&, ||, and !. All the && means is that when 
we have two expressions they both have to be true in order for the operator to return true. If one expression is not true then 
the operator will return false. For example if ( 100 > 10 && 10 === 10) and this is true then the operator will return true. The next
operator is the "OR" (||) and this indicates that if one expression is true then the operator will return true, and it will only return
false if both expressions are false.

Lastly we will talk about "for" loops, all a for loop is the evaluation of an expression over and over again in a until we determine
when it stops or not in the case of an infinite loop.
