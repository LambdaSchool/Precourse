The following are simple descriptions of several concepts.

1.) for - A for loop is a programming tool which allows us to repeat an action as many times as we want. It saves us from having to write code that we want to repeat over and over again. A for loop needs to know how many times to repeat a portion of code, or more specifically when to stop repeating. It does this by declaring the first part of the for loop, the iterator. This is just a variable we declare, usually a number, that we are going to start with. We then declare a stop condition, usually using the iterator. The stop condition is a check to see if our iterator has reached the end of it's journey. Our stop condition could be when our iterator is 3 higher than when it started, or 100 times higher than when it started, or even more. If the stop condition is not met, meaning our iterator is not yet at the value we set, perform the action in the loop. We change our iterator after every pass of the loop, by using the last part of the for loop, the incrementer. The incrementer is what changes the value of our iterator after, or before every pass of the loop

2.) && || ! - The logical operators are ways of combining or altering statements so that we can see if something is true, or not. When we want to combine two statements together, for example is x > 5 and is x < 20, so is x between 5 and 20, the && statement allows us to check both statements simultaneously, using if ( x > 5 && x < 20). Similarly, if we want to check if either x < 5 or x > 20, we could use the or operator ||. This allows us to check both of these conditions simultaneously, and return true if either one is true, like if (x < 5 || x > 20). The not operator ! allows us to check if a situation is NOT true. For example, if we wanted to find if x was not equal 10, we could use if (!(x === 10)), or if (x !== 10). If we simply want to make sure that x is not 10, the not operator allows us to avoid checking is a lot of other situations are true, like is x === 1, x === 2, x === 3 etc and just check to see if our variable is not 10.
