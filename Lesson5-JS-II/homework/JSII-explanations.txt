* `for`

A loop is a way to evaluate expressions over and over again until some condition we set is true.  "For" loops are a specific kind of loop where we pick a variable to act as a "counter", and to do something repeatedly - incrementing the counter with each pass - until the counter reaches a certain value that we specify.

* `&&`, `||`, `!`

"&&" is called "AND": it evaluates two statements, side by side, and if both are true, it returns true.  If one or both are false, it returns false.
"||" is called "OR": it evaluates two statements, side by side, and if at least one of them is true, it returns true.  If neither of them are true, it returns false.
"!" is called "NOT": it returns the opposite of whatever statement before which it is placed.
