1. for - A for statement starts a loop, which is a set of instructions in your program that keeps running until a certain condition is met (or not met, depending on how it's written). It's usually used with a counter; for example, if you want your program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 you would tell it "Start a counter at 1. For as long as the counter is less than 10, and also when it is equal to 10, print the number the counter is equal to. When the counter is bigger than 10, don't print the number. Instead, quit following these instructions and move on to the next bit."

&&, ||, ! - These are symbols we use to compare two things to each other. && means 'and,' which means you're looking for two or more things that are true. If everything connected by && is true, the whole thing is true. || means 'or,' which means you only need one of the things to be true. If one of the things is true, the whole thing is true. ! means 'not,' which means the actual answer is the opposite of what comes right after the ! symbol. So if you have a cat, !cat means something that is not a cat. If your program asks for !cat and you give it a cat, the result is false. I don't know why you'd ask for not a cat, though, since my cat is pretty damned awesome. :D
