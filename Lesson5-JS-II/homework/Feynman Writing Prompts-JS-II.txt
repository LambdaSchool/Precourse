* 'for'
    To do a certain thing again and again, we can use 'for' to make computer do the job. Just tell it how many times to repeat the job on what interval.

* '&&', '||', '!'
    && means and. Both conditions before and after && should be true.
    || means or. Either before or after || is true, the condition is true.
    ! means not.
