For: ‘for’ is the preceding keyword required to initiate what is known as a for-loop. A for loop allows you to set an initial starting point, a condition, and what to do until the condition is met. 	A for loop is often referred to as a ‘control flow’ statement, because it allows you to control the flow of execution for multiple pieces of code, via the starting point, condition and what’s necessary to do to meet the condition.

Logical Operators:

1.) &&: This is the logical ‘And’ operator, which is a way to set a condition that requires two statements to be true. For instance, the logical and operator would find the following statement true:

2 == 2 && 4 == 4
 
However, it would find both of these false (because both sides are required to be true):

1 == 3 && 4 == 4

1 == 2 && 3 == 6.

2.) ||: This is the logical ‘Or’ operator, which is a way to set a condition that requires at least one
of two statements to be true. The second statement above, ‘ 1 == 3 && 4 == 4 ’ would be better suited for the ‘Or’ operator as follows: ‘1 == 3 || 4 == 4 ’. The ‘Or’ statement will agree with this statement, because it only needs one part of it to be true.

3.) !: This is the logical ‘Not’ operator, which is a way to set a condition that, if something is true or false, switch it to the opposite value.  If you know that something evaluates to true or false, or just want to check for the boolean opposite, the ‘Not’ operator exists for that purpose. It often works in conjunction with the previous two operators in order to check more specific conditions.
