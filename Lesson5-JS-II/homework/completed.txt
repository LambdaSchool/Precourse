'for' statements: also known as a loop, this allows you to test things over and
over again until you get the result you want.

&&: means 'and'; both tests need to pass in order for the 'if' statement to be true

||: means 'or'; if either test passes, the 'if' statement will return true.

!: means 'not'; if the compared statements are not equal/greater/less than the 
other half of the statement, the statement is true.
