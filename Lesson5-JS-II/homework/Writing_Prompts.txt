for` is a loop.  it allows you to run a section of code multiple times for a defined number of times.

`&&` is simial to =and() formula in excel. everything in an `&&` needs to be true in order for the overall statement to be true.

'||` is similar to or.  `||` only needs one statement to be true in order for the overall statement to be true

`!` is equal to saying 'not' in a true of a false statement.  (!"A low paying data entry job is fun")
