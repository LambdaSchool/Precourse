Feynman Prompt JSII
'for', '&&', '||', '!'

I. 'for' -
for is a keyword that is used in order to tell the computer that we are about to write a for loop, something that can pick through items in an object to either find a particular one or do something to each one.

II. '&&', '||', '!' -
These are and, or, and not logical operators. They can be used to dictate how expressions should be read and treated by the computer in an 'if' statement.
