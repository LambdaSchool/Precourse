**for

A for loop is a structure that lets you work the same block of code
over a set number of times. This may often be used to perform a certain function
on each item in an array.

** &&

This is a logic operator "and"; both items on either side must be true for the value
to return true

** ||

This is another logic operator "or"; this will return true if either one of 
the values on either side return true.

** !

This reverses the true/false value of a statement. ex. !true evaluates as false

**Arrays

Arrays are lists of some kind of data all assigned into a single variable.
Each item corresponds to an index, so the data are searchable by location and
can be acted upon accordingly.
