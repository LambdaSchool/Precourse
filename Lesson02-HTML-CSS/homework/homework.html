<span id="spanId">My favourite food is Stir Fried Spaghetti. It is prepared by bringing a large pot of water to a boil and then cooking the spaghetti pasta in boiling water until al dente. After that, the spaghetti should be drained. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook garlic in oil for 1 minute. Stir in onion, and cook until soft. Stir in chicken, and cook until juices run clear. Mix in the broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, and cook for 2 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with soy sauce, salt, and pepper.Toss pasta with vegetables, and serve warm.
