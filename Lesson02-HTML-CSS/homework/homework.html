			Nothing can comfort me like a banana. I love my morning smoothies and bedtime snack. I eat about 4 a day and that is practicing portion control for myself because I could live off this delicious, yellow, versatile fruit. It's also a really cool word -- think about it.<br /><br />
			 A <b>banana</b> is an edible fruit -- botanically a berry -- produced by several different large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus <i>Musa</i>. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, in contrast to dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in sie, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.
