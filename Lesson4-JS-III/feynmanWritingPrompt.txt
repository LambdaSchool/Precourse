Objects are very similar to arrays. Objects are a list of information regarding one item, while arrays are different items that relate to each other, typically under the same category.

A property is another word for key. They are identifiers of the information stored for a object.

Methods are like functions for arrays, except they are assigned to objects.

For in loops are similar to the for loop function for arrays. The only difference is they are assigned to objects.

Dot notation vs bracket notation - dot notations are used to access key:value pairs (which are assigned to an object) and do not require a string. Bracket notation have the same function but require a string to be entered between the brackets. Bracket notation is used to assign a value while dot notation is used when a object has already been assigned a value.
