1. An object is used to hold related data about one thing using key-value pairs. For example, let's say you want to store details about the latest Star Wars film. 
    You could use an object to do that:
        let lastjedi = {
            name: "The Last Jedi",
            year: () => 2017,
            actors: ["Daisy Ridley", "John Boyega"],
            
        }
    As you can see, objects are a very descriptive way of storing information and are extremely flexible. You can store
    any data type in an object, even other objects!
    
2. An object property is a key.

3. An object method is a key whose value is a function.

4. An object doesn't have indices like an array, but with a for-in loop, we can treat it as if it were an array and 
    loop through each key-value pair.
    
5. Both dot and bracket notation are used to access values in an object. The difference is that the dot uses
    the plain name of the property/method whereas the brackets must have a string, number or variable to reference the key name.
