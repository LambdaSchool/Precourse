	* Objects
	* Properties
	* Methods
	* for in loop
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation

Objects
Objects contain keys, also termed properties. Objects can be called within JavaScript.

Properties
Properties, also called keys, can store information as well as perform functions.

Methods
A method is a key defined as a function on an object.

For in loop
This kind of loop acts as a function that looks for a key in an object, and performs
instructions with the information defined in those keys and objects.

Dot notation vs bracket notation
Dot notation is the term used when referencing a key on an object. However, in the
case of referencing a key of a key of an object, you must use brackets
around the parameter being referenced as the key of the key of the object.
For example say I wanted to go into my fridge, look on the shelf, and take out the
leftovers inside the tupperware.
In javascript, this action would be:

let fridge = {
    shelf: {
        tupperware: leftovers,
        soda: Pepsi,
        eggs: Large,
        carton: milk,
    };
};

return fridge.shelf(tupperware[leftovers]);
or
return fridge.shelf(tupperware[0]);
