Objects
*******
Objects are variables that can contain many values.
The values are written as key value pairs, key and value separated by a colon.

Properties
**********
The name value pairs in objects are called properties.
Objects will have property name and property value pairs.

Methods
*******
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.

for in loop
***********
for/in loops through the properties of an object. Syntax is
for (prop in object) {
    code block
}

Dot notation vs bracket notation
********************************
Dot notation and bracket notation are property accessors.
They provide access to an object's properties.
In a JS object, all property keys are strings.

Square bracket notation allows the use of characters that can't be used with dot notation.
Square bracket notation allows access to properties containing special characters and 
selection of properties using variables.

Dot notation only lets you access the explicit key name of a property.
Dot notation cannot be used with variables or numbers either.
