Objects in javascript are ways to store information in key value pairs, such as Hair: Brown. This allows more complex data manipulation.

Properties of objects are like "Hair". The object Jacob would have the property of Hair and then the value Brown.

Methods are functions inside objects. 

For in loops allow iterations over an object. A regular for loop would not be possible

Dot and Brackey notations are two ways to access values in an object. Jacob.Hair or Jacob[Hair]
