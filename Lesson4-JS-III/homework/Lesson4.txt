Objects: An object is a collection of properties. Objects hold information in one thing.

Properties: A property is an association between a name or value.

Methods: Methods are the actions that can be performed on objects. It is a property that contains a function definition.

for in loop: A for in loop iterates over the properties of an object. For each property, code can be executed.

Dot notation vs bracket notation: By using dot notation you can access properties of an object by specifying the name 
                                  of the object, followed by a dot and the property name. (object.property)
                                  By using bracket notation you can access properties of an object by specifying the name
                                  of the object, followed by the property name in brackets. (object[property])
                                  Dot notation is much easier to read than bracket notation.
