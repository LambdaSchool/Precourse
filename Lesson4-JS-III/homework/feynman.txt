Objects: Objects are a collection of key/value pairs (properties).

Properties: A property is a key and value pair inside an object.

Methods: Methods are the same thing as functions, but they only exist within an object. 

for in loop: A for in loop is a loop you can use to loop an object's properties.

Dot notation vs bracket notation: Dot notation and bracket notation are two different ways of writing code to access object properties.
