1) Objects are like dictionaries. It can hold many information about a particular thing. For example we can create a object with all the information about a certain person or even a certain car inside. I can create a object that defines the name, age, location, gender, etc. A car that defines the make, model, year, etc. The way objects stores all these information is by using key: value pairs inside of them.

2) Properties are the values inside a object. These values is what makes a connection between a key and a value pair.

3) Methods are functions inside of objects. We can take these methods and perfrom actions on them and make our object perform a certain task.

4) We use the for in loop to loop through properties of an object.

5) We use dot notation or bracket notation to gain access or assign values to properties in a object.
