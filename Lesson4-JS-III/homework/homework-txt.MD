1) Objects are like variables but they can contain many key/value pairs inside of them which can be accessed separately. We can picture this as a dictionary, with many properties which are the actual name and definition of that name.

2) Properties in objects are the key/value pairs. For example I can assign a key/value of my name and age in a object like name: 'Mario', age: 25.

3) Methods are functions inside of objects. We can take these methods and perform actions and make our object do something.

4) We use the for in loop to loop through properties of an object.

5) We use dot notation or bracket notation to gain access to the properties in our objects. Dot notation is much easier to read than bracket notation so it's used more often.
