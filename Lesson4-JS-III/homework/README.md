# Homework #JSIII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects	like an array but contains key:value pairs that can only be accessed using the key
	* Properties	the different keys of an object that will point to a specific value
	* Methods	will perform a function (action) when called
	* for in loop	allows you to cycle through an object without knowing the keys/properties of that object
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation	the dot method is mainly used when u know the property of an object, for varaibles containing strings that refer to a key, you would access with the bracket

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSIII` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
