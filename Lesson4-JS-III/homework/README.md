# Homework #JSIII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - Contains Key: Value pairs.
	* Properties - Variables of objects
	* Methods - Functions that exist in an object.
	* for in loop - A loop statement that will run as long as the condition is met.  Normally used to run through lists or arrays.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation - When accessing propertys and methods of an object, use dot notation when you know and are using the name of the property/object.  If the name of the property/object is saved as a string variable then use bracket notation.

	Object.property === Object['property']
	Object[stringVariable]  If stringVariable === 'property', then all 3 statements are the same.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSIII` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
