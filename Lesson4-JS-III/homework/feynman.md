      * Objects - everything in JavaScript is an object. Objects hold all the information listed but are limited to one thing. 
	    * Properties - properties are attributes of objects. For example if the object was you, your properties might include height, weight, favorite color, and age.
	    * Methods - methods are properties that do something. For example, if the object was you, you may have the ability to say hello to me. A method would not only define that ability but it would execute that ability as well.
	    * for in loop - for loops all us to loop through multiple items in an array so that we don't have to list each item specifically that we want to loop through
	    * Dot notation vs bracket notation - it seems to me that bracket notation is most useful when the property has a space in it or would otherwise require quotations
