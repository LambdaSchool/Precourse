Objects
    a container where you can access items by name
    group a bunch of different values under the same entity
    key value pair === properties
Properties
    key value pairs in an object
Methods
    like a function
for in loop
    loops through all of the keys in an object
Dot notation vs bracket notation
    dot: accesses a property in an object i.e. obj.property
    bracket: accesses a property in an object, but like an array i.e. obj[property]
    we prefer dot notation
