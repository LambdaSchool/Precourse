Objects
- These are similar to arrays, but larger. They contain data like arrays, but can contain different types of data. They contain booleans, numbers, strigs, arrays, and other objects.

Properties
- These are also known as keys and have an associated value. Within an object are key:values. Properties can have any designation.

Methods
- Another word for function, but refer to functions withing objects.

For in loop
-A special type of for loop that works in objects to iterate over ket:value pairs.

Dot vs Bracket notation
-Dot is preferred, but on some occasions bracket notation is necessary. I haven't really grasped the need for bracket notation.
