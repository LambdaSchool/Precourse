* Objects - hold information (called properties)on a lot of different parts of one thing
* Properties - are key:value pairs where the key is the thing you are talking about and the value is the information about the thing.
* Methods - a function as the value of a property
* for in loop - a way to go over each property of an object
* Dot notation vs bracket notation - dot notation (object.key) is most used to call a key on an object and bracket notation (object[variable]) is most used to call a variable on an object
