Objects are data containers that hold information about one thing.

A property is a key:value pair that can be added or removed from an object.

Methods are essentially functions (blocks of code) that are specific to an object.

A for in loop is a loop that iterates over each key:value pair in an object.

Dot notation is used to execute a method in an object.
Bracket notation is used to pass a value to a method.
