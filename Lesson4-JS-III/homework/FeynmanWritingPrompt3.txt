Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts 
like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly 
discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Objects - objects hold a lot of information about one thing; 
	objects are initilized by using curly braces
Properties - Properties are keys that hold values within the Object. 
	often called key:value pairs. They must be seperated by a comma.
Methods - Are functions saved on an object. Keys can have a value set to a function
	and this would be called a method.
for in loop - We use for...in to iterate over an object like we use "for" to iterate 
	over an array.
Dot notation vs bracket notation - We use dot and bracket notation to access
	properties in an object.
	DOT NOTATION: To use dot notation just call the object name, a dot, 
		and the key name (ex. user.username;)
	BRACKET NOTATION: Each key can be called by wrapping it with quotes
		(ex. user["username'])
