1. Objects
Objects are containers that can hold various properties and methods. While arrays can hold
information about many different things, objects hold similar data regarding one thing. In
many cases, an object is a representation of a real life object, like a car or a book. 

2. Properties
Objects have properties; properties are key:value pairs, where a value is assigned to a key.
The key of a property can be accessed either through dot notation ("objectName.key") or 
bracket notation ("objectName[key]"). For the last option, variables containing numbers or 
strings (or variables containing those) can be used. Properties can also be changed and 
removed by using the notation options mentioned above.

3. Methods
Methods are functions within objects. They can be set by assigning a function to a key 
in an object.

4. for in loop
As objects do not have any indices as arrays have, to access each value in an object for in 
loops are used. A for in loop finishes after looping over each key in the object.


5. Dot notation vs bracket notation 
Both dot notation and bracket notation are used on objects to access their properties and
methods. The difference is that bracket notation works with strings and numbers contained 
in variables, while dot notation directly tries to access a key, whether it's already 
present in the object or not. If it's not there, it will be created.
