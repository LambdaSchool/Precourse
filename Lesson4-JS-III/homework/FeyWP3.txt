    Objects - an object is very similar to an array, it is like a jar that can hold different types of values,
    its different from an array because an array can only hold one value type (a string, number, or boolean), however
    an object can hold all 3 if need be. Everythnig in JavaScript is an object. And objects
    can be put inside of arrays.

    Properties - Properties are also known as key value pairs. These are what go inside of your
    objects. You always want to put a trailing comma at the end of your value pairs.

    for in loop
  
    Dot notation vs bracket notation
