Objects - Objects are similar to arrays in that they hold a collection of data.
The key difference in the two data types is that an object holds key-value pairs
that normally all relate to the same thing.

Properties - Properties are the values associated with an object.

Methods - A method is a function set on an object as a value.

for in loop - A for in loop is used to iterate over object values like a for
loop is used to iterate over arrays of data. Data in an object can't be accessed
by a number index like an array so the for in loop must be used.

Dot Notation Vs. Bracket Notation - Both bracket and dot notation are ways of accessing 
values of an object. Dot notation is the most commonly used, however it has a number of
limitations. The property identifiers have to be alphanumeric but can
include both the '_' and '$' characters. They cannot contain numbers of
variables. In bracket notation property identifiers have to be a string
or a variable that references a string. It is considered best practice to use
dot notation unless you can't then you use bracket notation.
