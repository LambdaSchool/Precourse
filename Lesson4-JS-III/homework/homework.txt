	* Dot notation vs bracket notation

Objects:

Objects are like kind of like arrays, but instead of being a list of values,
they are a collection of pairs of values. The first value has to be a string
(and can only appear once in the object) but the second value has a lot of
freedom for what it can be. (Can it be anything? I don't know.)

(Or, you could think of an array as an object where each key is the number of
the value in that spot of the array.)

Properties:

I'm not 100% on this, but I think this is just the value that corresponds to
keys in an object when the value is not a function.

Methods:

...whereas this is the value that corresponds to keys in an object when the
value is a function.

for in loop:

A for loop (see previous Feynman promps) that loops over the keys or indices in
whatever is named after 'in.'

Dot notation vs bracket notation:

A value in an object has the name object.key or object[keyvar], where keyvar is
a variable holding the string that is the key. (That includes methods, but if
you want to actually call the method, add () after, so you can use object.key()
or object[keyvar]().)
