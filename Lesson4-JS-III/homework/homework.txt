	* Objects - Contains Key: Value pairs.
	* Properties - Variables of objects
	* Methods - Functions that exist in an object.
	* for in loop - A loop statement that will run as long as the condition is met.  Normally used to run through lists or arrays.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation - When accessing propertys and methods of an object, use dot notation when you know and are using the name of the property/object.  If the name of the property/object is saved as a string variable then use bracket notation.
