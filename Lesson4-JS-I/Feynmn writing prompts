Feynman writing prompt:

Variables:
Containers that can be filled with any value such as Boolean (true, false), numerals or strings.
Variables can be set to change or not change (constant).
EX: Boolean: true, false;   Numbers: 123456,010101   Strings: 'fwcjbdj', 'Sam'

Strings:
Groups of characters wrapped by quotation marks to be used as a data set.
EX: 'hffbrufhqleruf', 'Sam', 'Sam'+' '+'Kirkpatrick'

Functions:
Operations that engineers have computers perform using datasets, called 'arguments',
which are passed into operation (function) to be 'returned' after the
function (operation, evaluation) is complete.
EX: function(2,2); x=2, y=2; z=x*y; return z

'If' statements:
A conditional evaluation of the truth or falsehood of arguments passed in.
Part of control flow operators, 'if' frequently works with 'else', 'else if' and 'switch'
to determine the the truth or falsehood of arguments for further evaluation and return.
EX: if, 2*2=4, return true; else return false - return=true 

Boolean values:
Values that control flow operators use to 'test' arguments passed into functions
for return or further testing; such as 'if, else, swittch statements'. These are
true, false evaluations of arguments.
