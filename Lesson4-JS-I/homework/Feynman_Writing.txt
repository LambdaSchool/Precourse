1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a separate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Variables - Variables are things that store values in JavaScript. A box with marbles in it could be named marbles, and the variable would provide information about those marbles, such as the number of marbles (number is one type of variable), or the color of the marbles (let's say they're a mixture of blue and green in this particular variable).
	* Strings - Strings are things in JavaScript that store text-based information. So, 'blue and green' would be a string in JavaScript that would be one way to identify the variable we talked about above. You can also make numbers strings, but when you do that, you can't do any math with those numbers. So '1 + 2' -- once run through JS, would come back as 1 + 2. If you took the quotes off, it's no longer a string to JS, and it would return 3 as the answer. (That's math, which is another topic.)
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) -- Functions are pieces of code in JS that perform a task that we're defining for it. When you create (or declare) a function, you give it a name, argments (variables that the function has access to), and then tell it what to do (such as "Add these three numbers and tell me what the answer is.").
	* `if` statements -- 'if' statements tell JavaScript to do something, if something is True, or something else if that thing is False. The True or False classification is what is known as a boolean in JS (described below).
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) -- Boolean values come from very basic computer science. You can think of it as a "yes or no" answer to a question. In the case of JavaScript, it's a True or False answer. So when you use Booleans in JS, JS looks for that thing to be either True or False.
