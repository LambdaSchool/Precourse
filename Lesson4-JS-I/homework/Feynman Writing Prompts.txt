Variables - is a way to store the value of something to use later.  The anatomy of 
a variable is first the keyword, a space, the name we are giving the variable, an 
equal sign, the value we are assigning the variable and then the  semi-colon.  A 
vaiable can be declared using var, let, const.

Strings - Strings are blocks of text, they will always be defined with quotation 
marks around them, either single or double. Any text with quotes around it is a
string. 

Functions (arguments, return) - Functions computer variables.  

if statements - Checks to see if somethings is true and return a but if not true 
than return b.

Boolean values (true , false) - Booleans come from low level computer science.
It is a concept that powers binary code and the very core of computers. You may 
have seen binary code in the past (0001 0110...), this is boolean logic. It 
essentially means you have two choices, on or off, 0 or 1, true of false. In 
Javascript we use Booleans to mean true or false.
