# Homework: Introduction to Javascript, JSI

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Variables
        - Names that hold a value
	* Strings
        - Anything between single, double, and backtics
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
        - Do what you tell it to do with the code between curly braces. You can add arguments to make a function reusable myFunc(a, b). The only way to access a value from a function is to return it. Once your function encounters a return statement is will stop everything, not running any code below the return statement.
	* `if` statements
        If(true) the code inside will run otherwise the function will skip the if statement.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
        Open/Closed, On/Off basic concept in low level computer programming, binary code 01.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    - Done
3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm run test:JSI` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
    - New syntax `npm test JSI.test`
    - DONE
