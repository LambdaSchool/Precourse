Have you ever wanted to tell your computer to do your math homework
for you and a bunch of other stuff too? Well, if you have then you have 
to let me tell you about Javascript.

Lets begin with what is a variable? Well variables can be words or
numbers that tell the computer what something is and to store it. 
For example you could make a variable called myFavoritegame 
then you could type in the name of your favorite game so the computer 
understands what your are saying when you type myFavoritegame.

Games you like could monopoly, supermario, etc. For javascript to
understand what a word is it needs 'quotes'. For example 'monopoly'
'supermario'. In javascript words are called strings, so if you say
'I like to play supermario' javascript knows how to display the words
because of the quotes around them.

Javascript also has these things called functions that you can tell
them what to do like solving math problems.
You can type return (3 + 5); and it will give you the answer 8.

We know that 3 + 5 = 8, but you can also tell javascript to check 
if that is true or false with something called an if statement.
For example if (4 + 5 < 11) return true; else return false;. This 
tells javascript that if 4 + 5 is less than 11 to tell you the user 
that it's true. Conversly if 4 + 5 is not less than 11 it will tell
you that it is false.
