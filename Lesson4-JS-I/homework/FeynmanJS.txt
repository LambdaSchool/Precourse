Feynman Talks JS

* Variables
Variables are like a place where one use to take note or keep track of information/values for example numbers. As this information can vary in time, hence the name variables !

* Strings
An example of strings would be like the words and sentences in the language. We can identify them as they are placed in quotes. (single quotes)

* Functions (arguments, `return`)
This is like meaningful code chunks or little program snippets. Consider a simple function which adds 2 numbers. We can name the function 'Add' and the 2 numbers we give/input to the functions are called arguments. To obtain the answer (output) from the Add function... we can simply tell the function to "return" the answer.

* `if` statements
'If' statements allows us to make decisions and take different actions. For example, if is is raining, bring an umbrella, if it is very sunny, bring out your cool shades.

* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
This are information/ or values which allows us to say/express whether something is true or false. This is handy when used to make decisions or conditional actions such as the IF statments above.
