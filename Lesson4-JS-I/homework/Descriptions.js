// Variables --
// A container that's used to hold a value. Create a variable give it a name and then decide on a starting value. 
// That name then can be used in your code to modify or display the value but really it's better than to just use that value with a variable than it would be to fill in a number directly in the code. 
// It gives everything a level of abstraction and makes edits and things easier. Simply define the variable, then use the name to call it and begin to use it in your code. 
// It can still be changed and it'll effect the outcomes later. End with semicolon. There are many uses for this technique and it is wise to make use of them.
// Also A Contstant is avariable that dosen't change it's variable..

// Usage example:
// var FavoriteAnimal = 'Panda Bear';
// let FavoriteFood = 'Bamboo';
// const AnimalDoesWhat = 'Eats Bamboo';


// Strings--
// Strings are really simple. USing single or double quotes, surround some text and it becomes a string. Ready to be used in the code in several ways.

// Usage example:
// 'My visit to the Zoo was really amazing. I loved how the animals reacted to the people around thema and that so many creatures had such opena and beautiful enclosures.'

// Functions (arguments, return)--

//A function is a code block that tells your variable or other code concepts to accomplish something. It has arguments, which are what you are telling the code is the task at hand.. and it tries to do what the function asks based on what you wrote.
// A return stateent is like a escape for the block of code, also a way to end the sequence and compute the result. It will calculate the code and do what you asked..

// Usage example:
// function logsHello(name) {
//    console.log('Hello, ' + name);
// }

// logsHello('Dan');

// if statements-- 

// In essense, If statements are a way to check if a given block of code is correct, or true and then if so, it discribes what will occur once found to be true. 
// Basically it tests a value and if turns out to be true, then it will complete another instruction, if not, it won't follow those instructions..

// Usage Example:
// function canDrive(age) {
//    if (age > 15) {
//        return true;
//    }

//    return false;
// }

// canDrive(16); // true

// Boolean values (true, false)--

// When comparing true or false, a Boolean value is just that, the choice of true or false. 
// It is used to compare things for if statements and to have the code do more advanced techniques later on.

// Usage Example:
// function canDrive(age) {
//    if (age > 15) {
//        return true;
//    }

//    return false;
// }

// canDrive(16); // true
