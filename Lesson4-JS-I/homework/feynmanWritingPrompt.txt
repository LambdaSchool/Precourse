My explaination/understanding of the concepts below

1. variable : A variable can be thought of as a container for keeping items. Let's say you go fishing, and for every
that you catch, you have to store them in a container. So, the container here can be thought of as a variable because
it helps you keep your fish (data) so that you can use after you're done fishing.

2. String : They are basically just sequence of characters wrapped around a single quote or double quotes.

3. Functions : Could be thought of as like a "verb" in english language. It's full of "action!". A function helps us
create functionalities within our program. So, for a function to be effective, it has to actively produce a value (return a value),
that's what makes it a function (actionable) because it always returns a value (does something); Sometimes, we can choose
to make our functions behave in a more dynamic way(returning different values and not just one static value), hence we 
might choose to pass in an argument, in many cases, the argument might be of different values which makes it more interesting
because as the value of the arguments passed to the function changes, the return value of the function changes.
The holy grail of function dynamism! 

4. 'if' statements - An 'if' statement is a fork-in-the-road; it's a decision maker; can be thought of as a control flow
for our program. We say "if this thing," then "do that thing"; else if "this other thing", then "do that other thing".

5. Boolean values - That data that has just 2 values attached to it. It's safe to think of as either 1 or 0; white or black;
on or off, true or false.
