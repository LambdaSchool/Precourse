variables  = storage of something

strings = "text surrounded by quotations marks"

functions = a general mechanism to execute code

arguments = the specific variables we pass into the functions

return = sends the solution outside of the function and stops the execution of the function

if statements = a way to create multiple possibilities (if the conditional statement is true, the code within the if statement executes; if not the function checks the next conditional until it finds a true statement)

boolean values = true or false
