1. Variables

Variables are containers that you can tell to hold information, or data.
They let you label pieces of information so you can easily call on them or reuse them later.
They can be declared (created) in one of three ways: the keywords var, let or const
like so:

  let juiceBox = "blackcurrant";

After the variable has been declared, the data they've been assigned to can change.
So later, if you decide you're tired of blackcurrant juice, you can use Javascript
to change what juiceBox contains!

  juiceBox = "orange"

2. Strings

A string is any piece of text surrounded by quotation marks, either single '' or double "".
It's one of the three main primitives in JavaScript. Both "burritos" and "I love burritos"
are strings, even "asdlfkja;lskgdj19023" is a string, though a fairly incomprehensible one.


3. Functions, Arguments and Return

A short recipe for the computer to cook up, each function is a block of code that provides
a set of instructions for the computer to carry out.

Like the special ingredients that you want to make a particular recipe with,
arguments are variables that are passed through to the function for it to work on.


Return statements are what end functions and return a value.

4. if statements

IF statements are like signposts that tell the program which way to run.
The if block checks if a condition is true, then runs the code the block contains.

if (this is true) {
  run this code
} else {
  run this code instead
}

5. Boolean values

Boolean values are like on/off switches, with true/false replacing the power.
