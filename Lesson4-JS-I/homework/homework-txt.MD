1) Variables are used to store data types. We can think of them like a box that has a label sticked in front of it describing what information that it's storing inside.

2) Strings are blocks of text wrapped either in single or double quotes.

3) Functions are used to perform tasks or to calculate values. We can pass them parameters to be used when we call/invoke the functions. Arguments is the opposite of parameters and are passed inside the parenthesis that is being used to call a function. The return statement is used to return us a value from a function. Any code that's put after the return statement will not be executed since code stops running after the return statement is executed.

4) If statements are used to check if a condition is either true or false

5) Booleans are used to give us a true or false, ON or OFF, YES or NO answer. They are returned within if statements, returned when we're comparing numbers to each other and in many other situations.
