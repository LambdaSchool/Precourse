1) Variables are used to store or hold data types. We can think of variables like boxes that store data inside of them. A label sticker in front of the box would describe what kind of information the variable is holding inside. This sticker would be the name we choose for our variable that best describes the information that it stores inside.

2) Strings are text surrounded by single or double quotes.

3) Functions are used to perform tasks or to calculate values. It can take in parameters as input and when we call/invoke our function we can pass them arguments in the order that we passed them the parameters so we get back a output. We use the return statement inside of a function to return us a value from inside the function. The return statement stops the execution of a function and won't return us anything after the return statement.

4) We use if statements to evaluate if a condition is true or false.

5) Boolean values are like switches for ON or OFF, YES or NO. It returns to us whether something is true or false.
