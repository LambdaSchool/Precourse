1. Feynman Writing Prompts

		
	* Variables
		
		We use variables in Javascript to assign a name and value to something.  This way it will be easier to remember and retrieve the values they represent.     
    


	* Strings
	
		Strings can be text or numbers that are enclosed by single or double quotation marks. 



	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	
		Functions are used to change variables just like how math equations change and manipulate numbers.

		Arguments are the values that we declare for a function. For example, x and y can be any number. 
	
		Return executes what value the function is calling for.  



	* `if` statements

		'If' statements specify what conditions should be met for the statement to be returned either true or false.   


	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

		Boolean values in Javascript are either True or False.  Boolean statements will always check if the statement is True or False.
