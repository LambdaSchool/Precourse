Feynman Writing Prompts - In a separate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following 
concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes 
in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Variables
 -- Variables are placeholders for complicated pieces of code so that you don't have to write the same thing
 over and over. It lends to less errors in code so you won't have to go fishing for a bug later if your code 
 doesn't work.
Strings
-- Strings are pieces of code that are made up of letters, spaces, special characters or numbers. 
They are enclosed in single or double quotes. 
Functions (arguments, return)
-- a Function is a block of code that performs a certain task. That function contains paramaters that can be 
later invoked to pass as arguments. These parameters are a type of variable that is defined only within the
function. 
if statements
-- if statements are blocks of code that perform one statement or another depending on the outcome of the initial
line of code. For instance:  if 1<5 ===true, it will perform the line of code that is associated with being true.
If it happened to be false, it would jump to the line associated with the statement being false. 

Boolean values (true, false)
--Boolean values are like basic light switches - there are two options: true or false.
