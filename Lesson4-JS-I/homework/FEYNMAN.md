1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables = Variables is one of the most important tool in a programming language and it allows us to store data to use on a later occasion. We later access it by calling it by it's unique name. Variables can be changed later on the code making them dynamic. 
	* Strings = Strings store letters and it can be a word or sentence. 
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) = A function is a block of code that can hold an argument that when called we can set the value of. It can be used multiple times in our code making code a lot easier with less repetitiveness. Sometimes we want to return a certain piece of data and with the return we can take data out the function.
	* `if` statements = If statements are conditional statements that work with boolean values. For example what do you do when you're hungry? You eat. In an if statement we can define that if we are hungry (true) we eat and if we are not we don't
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) = One of man's most interesting inventions on my opinion. Boolean values are like binary 1 for true and 0 for false and it's the most basic form of data. We can use this simple pieces of data to set instructions for our program. Like the definition of if statements that's one example on how we can use boolean values.
