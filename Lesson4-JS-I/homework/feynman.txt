* Variables

-- think of an empty box. we can put anything in this box. variable is just like that empty box, where we store our values.
whatever they are - numbers, text, boolean etc.

* Strings

-- when we join characters to create words in our programmes. we call these words as strings.

* Functions (arguments, `return`)

-- think of it like instructions to create or do something. like cooking, where we put in pour raw material,
add some heat and boom we have a the french onion soup

* `if` statements

-- remember that song - "if you ever leave me! i will be sad and blue". "if" is similar in programming
do this if this happens. if  - you leave - i sad! lol!

* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

-- I love you, I don't love you! these are the complimentary values. if one is true another cant be true.
this is useful, especially when we need certainty in our programme.
