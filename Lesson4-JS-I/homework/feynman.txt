Hey there <name>! These are the basics to understanding the programming language known as Javascript!

Let's start with variables.

Variables are a way to save any type of information you want to a specific name that you choose. This type
of information could be any kind of number or letters you want.

If you want to save this information as letters you have to make sure you put single or double quotations
around the letters you want to save. Such as 'letters' or "letters". This makes sure the computer saves the
information as letters and not numbers. The variables that are saved as letters are called strings.

If you want to save special types of number or specific calculations you can use basic math aritmetic as
you save your information. Such as saving "2 + 2" or "54 / 9" and so forth.

There are ways to manipulate this information you have saved and make it do thing that you want with
methods called functions. You can give functions whatever name you want and usually it has something to 
do with what it is performing such as "makeFunction" or "isNumberEven". You provide the instructions for
the function and then you either return the values manipulated or you return whether the information is 
true or false.

Sometimes you want to manipulate the information only if they meet certain requirements and for this you
use if statements. With an if statement you can ask if a variable with conditions like is it true, false,
if its a number greater than 20, or divisible by 5. If and only if the variable meets the conditions then
it performs its specific instructions, otherwise the computer just keeps on reading the code.

True or false in this manner are asking whether the statement you made is right such as if you ask if
two numbers add up to a specific number than it will be true if not it will be false. Is 30 greater than
50? No it is not, so in that argument it would be false. Is 50 greater than 25? Yes, so in the computer's
eyes it will be true.
