Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

1.Variables
2.Strings
3.Functions (arguments, return)
4.if statements
5.Boolean values (true, false)


1. A variable is like an alias.  It allows you to give a new name to something.  For example, if you ride in a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee, you can call it the Jeep, bobs car, or a broke ass ride, and it is easy to understand what you are referring to.  

2. A function is a defined task.  If someone tell you do to your homework, this is a function.  And augment is a way to put information into a function.  Similar to someone saying do your (insert subject) homework. A return is the result of that function.  

3. An 'if' statement is a way to add some logic to.  Go to the living room, if the front door is unlocked, lock it, if it is already locked, leave it locked.

4. Boolean values are values that only have 2 possible absolute outcomes.  Yes/No, On/Off, 0/1, True/False.  A boolean value can never be 'Maybe'
