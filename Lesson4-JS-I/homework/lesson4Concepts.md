# lesson4Concepts: write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.

* Variables
    Variables are a way to store the value of something in order to use in some way later on (manipulate it, display it, store it, etc.). In some programming languages you need to declare the type of data (Number, String, etc.) you are storing in inside a variable ahead of time but not in Javascript.

* Strings
    Strings are considered primitive data, which are the basic building blocks of data in programs, that is basically made up of symbols or characters "strung" together. We normally use single quotes for our strings in Javascript 'like this'. 
    
    Remember that if numbers are written inside strings they are characters in that string to be displayed, not numbers to be evaluated. '123' doesn't have the actual value of one hundred twenty three that can be manipulated in some way, it's just a string to be displayed. 123 on the other hand is considered one hundred twenty three, since it's a Number (data type).
    


* Functions (arguments, `return`)
    Functions have a name we create (blingBling) or that are already built-in to our programming languages/tools with one or more parameters (gold, diamonds) or points of comparison. 
	
    "function blingBling (gold, diamonds){}"

	They have an area between the curly braces after the name where  expressions are worked through by the computer to produce the resulting value of the function when initiated/asked for and given the points to fill in the previous parameters with.
	
	A main reason they are integral to programming is their reusability.


* `if` statements
    Javascript if statements are one of the most popular actions in javascript programming, and it allows you to make logical comparisons between a value and what you expect. In its simplest form, the IF statement says:

    If (this something) is True, then do that something, otherwise do something else.

    So an if statement can have two results. The first result is if your comparison is True, the second, the else,  is if your comparison is False.

* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
    Boolean is another primitive data type (i.e. basic building block), that is made up of just two values: true and false (e.g. 1 and 0, on and off).

    const hungry = true;
    const full = false;
