			<dt>Variables</dt>
			<dd>Variables are like nouns. They describe bits of memory that do things or have things done to them by the program you're writing. Just like a noun can be a person, place, thing, or idea, there are different kinds of variables too.</dd>
			<dt>Strings</dt>
			<dd>Strings are a particular kind of variable. A string is a group of text characters and it can include letters, numbers, and other types of characters (like ! or &amp;).</dd>
			<dt>Functions</dt>
			<dd>If variables are like nouns, functions are more like verbs. They do things. They can even take variables in the form of arguments, do something with them, and then return something to the program based on what they did. Conveniently enough, the way a function gives something back to the wider program is called a <code>return</code>&mdash;it's like the feature describes itself. ;)</dd>
			<dt><code>if</code> statements</dt>
			<dd>An <code>if</code> statement lets your program do one thing if a certain thing is true, and another thing if it's not true. For example, if you have a function that allows your user to enter The Matrix, you'll want to see <code>if</code> they've chosen the red pill or the blue pill. <code>if</code> they pick the red pill, then the code that lets them enter The Matrix should run. If not, it doesn't.</dd>
			<dt>Boolean values</dt>
			<dd>A Boolean value simply means something is true or false. There are no shades of grey. Do or do not; there is no <code>try</code>. We'll talk about <code>try</code> statements later, I'm sure.</dd>
