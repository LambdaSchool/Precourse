Variables are a way of setting values to a name of your choosing. You can do this in javascript by using a keyword(var, let, or const), setting a name and assignment operator, and the value
ended by a semicolon.
For example, let dogName = 'Rocky';. let is the keyword, dogName is the name, = is the assignment operator, and Rocky is the value.

Strings are text values set between two quotes. For example: 'one'

Functions (arguments, 'return') are ways to run code. You can receive another value after plugging in other values (arguments). Return gives you the result of the function or whatever
values you plug in.

'if' statements check if something is true. If the statement is true, it runs the code given. If not it returns the other code given from false.

Boolean values ('true', 'false') have two options. You can describe these options as true or false. They run different code depending on the result.
