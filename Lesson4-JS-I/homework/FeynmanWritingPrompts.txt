A variable is a word that refers to a particular value.

	var name = 'Pip';

	name is the variable, so where ever the variable (name) is written, 'Pip' will be entered into that space.

A Javascript string stores a series of characters like 'Sally Mae'.  A string can be any text inside a double or a single quote.

A Javascript function is defined with the function keyword, folowed by a name, followed by parentheses ().  
Functions names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
The code to executed by the function is placed in side curly brackets, {}.
	
	function name(parameter1, parameter2) {
		code to be executed
	}

Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.
	
	function logsHello(name) {
		console.log('Hello, ' + name);
	}
	
	logsHello('Dan');	'Dan' would be the argument.

The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.
	
	function square (x) {
		return x*x;
	}
	var demo = square (3);
	//demo will equal 9

The if statement is the fundamental control statement that allows Javascript to make decisions and execute statements conditonally.  

If the resulting value is true, the given statement is executed.

A Javascript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.
	Boolean (10>9) //return true
	Boolean (1>9) //return false
