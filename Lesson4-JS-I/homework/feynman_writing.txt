1.) Variables are names that we assign to data to help us
    follow that data around in a meaningful way

2.) Strings are a collection of characters grouped together.

3.) Functions are the pieces of your code that actually do
interesting stuff. They can take data as input and return
different data as output.

4.) `if` statements run code depending on wether a condition
is satisfied or not

5.) Boolean values are either true and false and are used
in if statements and other areas of your code where a condition
is being checked for true or false.
