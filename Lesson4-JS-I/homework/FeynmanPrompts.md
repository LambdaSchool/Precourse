- Strings = a data type that is usually a word having no numeric value, defined by either single `''` or double `""` quotation marks.
- Functions (arguments, `return`) =  how to manipulate data, which accepts arguments when running, and can also return values via the `return ` method.
- `if` statements = conditional statements that determine the execution of functions or parts of functions if the condition is true.
