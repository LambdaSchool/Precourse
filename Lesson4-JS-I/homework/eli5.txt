variables - variables are containers for storing data. This is very useful because as we have lots of data that we use often,
instead of rewriting the data each time, we just store the data once in the variable and call upon the variable each time 
we wish to use that data.

strings - A string is data that is in the form of text. To make something a string we surround it by '' or "".

functions-  A function is a set of statements that performs a task. Instead of writing out these statments for the computer to 
perform each time, we call upon the function each time instead saving us time and space.

function arguement - A crucial part of a function is the ability to perform the same task on different sets of data. The data that we 
want to manipulate is called the arguement of the function. 
function return - the return statement stops the function from further executing code inside of the function . 

if statements- When one wants to execute code, only in certain instances, he has the option to use an if statement. The if statement, 
will only execute the code it contains if the statement provided is true.

boolean values- When determining if a data type is correct or not we have boolean values that determine the veracity.
For example 5>3 produces true while 5<3 produces false . boolean values can be used with any type of logic that can be true or false.
