Variables: A container for storing data values.

	   the way I see variables work Is that I use a letter or a word 
	   to name my function and I set it equal to a value or I have 
	   an annonomus function which has a letter or a word I use as
	   it's name, whereas later on I call it by using the letter or
	   name followed by (); these parentheses. What I put inside the
	   Parentheses is either my Variable or some other data type.
