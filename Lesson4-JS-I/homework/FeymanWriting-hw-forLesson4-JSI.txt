Answers:

Variables are things you want to store for later use. They can be words or text, numbers, or true/false values. They can be assigned or changed. Variables are how you tell the computer to store them for you.

Strings are any text (or numbers you are not going to use for any kind of calculations) that you store in a variable.

Functions are directions you give the computer to do things for you with the variables you have stored.

"If" statements are ways to explain what the computer should do in different cases or situations.

Boolean values are true or false values that you store in variables.
