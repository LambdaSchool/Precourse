1. Variables = JavaScript variables are containers that store information. 
Just like in math, when x = a number, let's say 6, the x is the name of the variable, and 6 is the variable's output.
This allows us to write a math problem, but substitute any number for x. 
2. Strings = Strings are any characters, surrounded by single (or double, but prefer single) quotes. What is inside the
quotes is the string and will be printed when the return command is given. 'all of this text is considered a string 
along with any numbers or punctuations'.
3. Numbers = are only numbers. No quotes. Can be positive or negative numbers.
4. Functions = a function statement states that some variables are coming up that needs computing - to change them somehow.
The arguments inside a function, is where the variables will be plugged in and computed. The return statement is when 
the data will be accessible outside of the function. Once a return statement is made, the function immediately stops.
5. if statments = allow for us to check if something is true, nd either running the code supplied if it is, 
or moving on if it is not. 
6. Boolean values = are only either 'true' or 'false'. It is best used in conjunction with an If statement. If the statement 
is true, do this. If not (and it is false) then do that instead.
