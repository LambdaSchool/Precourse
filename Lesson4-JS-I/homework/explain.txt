variables: can define a value(string, number, method, etc). Things are stored in variables for readability and efficiency
ex: var name = 'Alexandra';
strings: usually a word or sentence that is being printed somewhere. Must have quotes around it
ex: 'hi';
functions: a layout or method of doing something. It can be used many times over and is very efficient.
ex: you can have a function that multiplies two numbers and returns the value. when you call the function it would take whatever two values you input and run the program with those numbers
if statements: Give the if statement conditions and if it is true of false something given will happen
ex: if 2 + 2 == 4 is true then multiply the number by 2 and return it.
boolean values: true and false are boolean values.
ex: 1 == '1' is a boolean statement and false is a boolean value
