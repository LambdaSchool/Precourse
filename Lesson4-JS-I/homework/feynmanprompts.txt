1. What are variables?

	A variable is a name used to store different data types in Javascript into memory. The information inside 
	a variable can be changed (unlike a const, which will always contain the same information once it is set).

2. What is a string in JavaScript?

	A string is a data type consisting of any text within opening and closing quotation marks.

3. What is a function in JavaScript?
	
	A function is a reusable portion of code that is used to compute things related to variables.

	3a. Arguments

		An argument is a variable unique to a function that is set in the parentheses directly after the 
		function name.

	3b. 'return'

		A function will only work up until it hits the word 'return'. 'return' acts like an off switch or 
		exit button within a function, and any code after the 'return' will not be executed. It also returns
		a value when the function is called.

4. What are 'if' statements?
	
	An if statement is a portion of a function that checks to see if a condition of true. If it is true, the 
	commands within the if statement will run, otherwise the program will skip the contents of the if statement 
	and move to the portion of the function that comes after it.

5. What are Boolean statements?

	A Boolean is a data type that either equates to 'True' or 'False'.
