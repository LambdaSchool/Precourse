1) We can think of variables as boxes that store values inside of them with a name label sticked to the front of it describing the variable.

2) Strings are blocks of text wrapped in double or single quotes.

3) Functions are used to calculate values or perform a specific task. We can pass them parameters for when we call them we can invoke arguments into them so it returns us the encapsulated parameters inside the scope of the function. Arguments are just what we put in the parenthesis when we're calling a function. The return statement is used to return us a value from a function. Any code after the return statement will not execute and we will get back only the return statement where the code stopped running.

4) If statements are used to evaluate if a certain condition is true or false.

5) Boolean values are used to give us a YES or NO, ON or OFF answer. They are returned within if statements, returned when we're comparing numbers to each other and many other comparison statements out there.
