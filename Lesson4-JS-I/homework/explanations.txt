* Variables

A variable is like a container that you put something in so that you can get it out and use it later.
	
* Strings

A string is a piece of text made of characters.

* Functions (arguments, `return`)

A function is a set of repeatable instructions like in a cooking recipe. 

* `if` statements

The if statement just means that you will do the following instructions if a certain condition is met. You will not do them if the condition is not met.

* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

A boolean value is one of the types of values in JavaScript, but it can only be true or false.
