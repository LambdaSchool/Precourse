A variable is a container where we can store data, and we give the variable a name to help us remember what is in the container or what type of data the container can store.
Variables can store things such as letters, numbers, and true or false values.

A string is a variable that contains characters surrounded by quotes.

A function is block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can accept arguments and return a value. An argument is data that you pass to the function to use.

An if statement is code that is performed if a condition is met. If the condition is not met, then it ignores that part of the code and moves on to the rest of the function.

A boolean is a value that is either true or false.
The conditions in if statements, loops and any other statements that control the flow of the program use boolean values to run or ignore that part of the code.
