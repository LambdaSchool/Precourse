Variables: a container to hold whatever you want - words (strings), numbers, and even complex formulas.

Strings: any number of letters and numbers - essentially, a short sentence

Functions: a set of instructions that can use user-specified values (arguments) to make calculations and other repetitious 
tasks simpler. You can also have the function return/display the result of the function and arguments that you gave it.

'if' statements: this will check an argument to see if it is true or not, and will follow the instructions that you give
depending on if the statements are true or not.

Boolean values: these can either be true or false; you can use this to check math formulas that you write, and can also be 
used to compare user-provided text to stored information.
