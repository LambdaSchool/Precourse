# Variables
		Is making a sentence that will go into a paragraph later to complete a story. It is made up of several parts that help make sense when added to the paragraph. You have to state your writing a sentence then give it a name and equal that to whatever name you choose.
# Strings
		Strings are simple words that are in parenthesis.
# Functions (arguments, `return`)
		A argument is like setting up what you want your function to do or execute. Like real arguments you make a statement if something is true or false it depends on what the argument is about but it will answer the statement. A return is like the "=" on a calculator it tells the function to return the total of the argument or solution.
# `if` statements
		Are statements with conditions that can either be true/false or switch. Think about the song "If your happy and you know it" when the teacher says "if your happy and you know it clap your hands" you respond with your if statement since your happy you will clap in return. Same concept applies but can become more complicated you can return with your not happy and stomp your feet in return.
# Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
		Booleans are simplified "if" statements kinda they only have a true/false answer to a question.
