Variables are like labeled boxes on a toy shelf. All toy boats are placed in the box labeled "boats". 
All the police cars are placed in the box labled "police cars".
All the firetrucks are placed in the box labled "fireturcks". All the balls are placed in he box labled "balls".
It makes it much easier when your toys are sorted so that when you want to play rescue team, 
you just pull the boxes labled "police cars" and "firetrucks" off the shelf, and you are ready to go.

Strings are like containers used to store alphabet letter toys. The letters, punctuations, spaces, symbols, etc. stored in this type of container are to be read as just text.
They cannot be used to represent anything other than what they actually are. You know it is a string if the letters, punctuations, spaces, symbols, etc. are enclosed in 
single or double quotation marks.
