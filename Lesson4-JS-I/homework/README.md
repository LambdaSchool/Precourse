# Homework: Introduction to Javascript, JSI

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables - containers to store some kind of data
	* Strings - text (literal) with quotes around it
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	  Functions - block of code that we can reuse, call when an event occurs
      Arguments - variables that serve as placeholder for passing values
      Return - to let data to be accessed outside of the function

	* `if` statements - function that check if something is true
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - data type that takes two values only : True of False


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSI.test.js` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
