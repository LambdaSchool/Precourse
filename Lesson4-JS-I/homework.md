## Variables - 
    Variables store values, so if I say "let a = 0", I can go back later and get the value of a.
    I can also change the variable a after the fact, saying "a + 150", a will then be equal to 150.

## Strings - 
    Strings are a kind of like a variable, but with text. Using the example above, I can say "let a = 'pizza'",
    then say something like "a + ' orange'", and a will then equal "pizza orange".
## Functions -
    Functions are operations I want the program to take when called. They can take arguments, which are like variables
    you want the function to act on. The function then can "return" a value, after it has completed its instructions.
## 'If' statements.
    If statements are conditional, so if I were to say "If you did your homework, go play video games"
    Obviously, if you did your homework, I just told you to go play video games. But if the condition, you doing your homework,
    is not true, you would skip that instruction and continue on.
