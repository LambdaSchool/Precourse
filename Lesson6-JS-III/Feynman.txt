Arrays:  Arrays are lists of items. The items can be strings, numbers, functions... whatever you want!  Each one has an index, starting at 0 and counting up by one. So the last item in an array is always the length of the array minus one. Arrays come with methods which let you add in new items to the list (such as push, which adds an item to the end) or remove items (such as shift which removes an item from the front, thereby changing the numbering).  You can do something to each item in the list or do something with each piece of information in the list using for loops.
