* Arrays
    Arrays are a collection of items, usually thought of as a list of objects, like strings, numbers, or maybe other arrays. A string is represented as a list of
    comma seperated items in brackets.

        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const letters = ['A', 'B', 'C'];

    We could mix and match, but it's best practice to keep together items of same type like numbers or strings in an array, even though there may be times when We
    put different types in one array.

        const employee = ['John Kelly', 45, 'Manager'];

    where 45 could be his age or some other status.
