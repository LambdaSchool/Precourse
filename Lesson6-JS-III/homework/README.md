# Homework #JSIII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Arrays

An array is a variable that instead of one value, it holds multiple values in a list format. How it keeps track of this list is by giving the position they are in a number, but the first position it start at is 0. For example, the array var numbers = [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]; 22 is at position 0, 23, is at position 1, 24 is at position 3, and so forth. An important thing to remember about arrays and finding something within an array's list is that the positions they are in always starts at 0.

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
