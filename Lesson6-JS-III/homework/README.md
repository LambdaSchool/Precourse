# Homework #JSIII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Arrays - It allows you to store a vast amount of information in a single container. For example, think of a school and teachers. The school is a single container that holds all the teachers in one place. So you can pull any teacher out of school, instead of having multiple placeholders (variables) for all the teachers. So Arrays allows us to extract more information from a single container. 

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
