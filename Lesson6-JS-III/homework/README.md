# Homework #JSIII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Arrays - (explained to a 12 year old) Picture arrays like a field seperated by fences. Each fence can hold whatever you put in it. You can put a house in the fence, but you can also put a cow in it. Or even a goat. You can even put other tiny fences inside of the fences. If you want to see what's inside the fence, you would have to go to each 'section' inside the fence to see what's inside of it. (A little more complexly) Arrays are really just lists of data. They can store and hold objects, variables, and different information types. An array that has nothing in it's "key" has a 'null' value. To access the array, you need to go to it's location. To find information in it's first location, you would need to go to ary[0], since arrays start at a location of 0.

2. 3. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
