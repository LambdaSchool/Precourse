* Arrays: An array is a container for storing collections of data. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable. the syntax of an array is:

var array_name = [item1, item2,...];

To access the values in the array, you refer to an index number. The index number for the first item in the array is 0, that of the second item is 1, that of the third item is 2 and so on. so to acces the 6th item of an array called arr, you would type: arr[5];

To access the full array, you refer to the array name.
