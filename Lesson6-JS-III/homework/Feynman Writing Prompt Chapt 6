Feynman Writing Prompt for Chapter 6:
Array:

Arrays are data structures used in javascript to assign single variables that are used to
store multiple elements. Arrays are a type of object where the elements are organized in
numerical order and are accessible by using that numerical order.

They are accessible by functions and have properties such as 'push', 'pull', 'pop' and .length
that allow engineers to manipulate the elements within the array and make returns.

The array data structure allows the use of 'for loops' that iterate through the elements in
the array conducting tests to return information about the array.
