Arrays

Arrays are collections of items of any type. The contents of the array can have items of differing types so we can have, for example, an array with names and ages. When we first create an array, it can start off empty or prepopulated. To find the number of items in the array, we use the '.length()' function. To add an item to the end of an array, we use the '.push()' function. To remove an item from the end of the array, we use the '.pop()' function. To add an item to the beginning of the array, we use the '.unshift()' function. To remove an item from the beginning of the array, we use the '.shift()' function. Each item in an array can be referenced by its numerical position. However the first item in the array is at position 0 since arrays in JavaScript or 0-based, meaning array indexes start at 0. To retrieve a value from a position in the array, we use the '[]' notation. For example if we have a array called 'students' with 5 names, and we want the thrid name, we would then write 'students[2]'.
