Arrays - arrays are considered data structures, similar to variables. variables only hold once piece of data, and arrays are able to hold multiple pieces of data, hence the name data structure. to create an array you first let the computer know you are about to create one, you do that the same way as letting the computer know you are going to write a variable, with var, let, or const. the difference is, when you write the data, you are going to write the data inside brackets[], this will allow you to write multiple pieces of data. You will seperate this data with commas. for example, if you want to hold multiple numbers, you can write something like, const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5]; .. you can have any piece of data inside an array, from strings, to numbers, to booleans, even other arrays.
