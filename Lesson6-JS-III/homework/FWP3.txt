Arrays: An array, usually signified by solid brackets ([]), is often referred to as a data structure, which
effectively means that it is a container, like a variable. The main difference between arrays and regular variables,
is that arrays can hold multiple pieces of data, and can order this data, giving the individual pieces of data what's called an index.
The index can be thought of as each piece of data's place in line, within the array.
