Like a list, arrays bundle multiple items into one variable.
Arrays are declared like variables,
followed by list of items contained surrounded by hard brackets [] and separated by commas.

const pencilCase = ['pencil', 'eraser', 'sharpener']

They help group like items and make explicit meaningful relationships between data.

You can call on specific items by calling on their index. pencilCase[0] === 'pencil'

In computer data structures, the order generally starts from zero.
So the thing humans call the third item in the array is pencilCase[2].
