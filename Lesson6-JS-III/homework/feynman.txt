Arrays are a way to include more than one type of data in an organized fashion. You can add as many
different types of data you wish to store to an array. Using the positions of each variable stored
with indexes we can easily access and manipulate data at their position. With a pre-existing array 
there is the capability of adding and removing data from the beginning or the end of the array. Array 
contains all different kinds of functions that are native to them.
