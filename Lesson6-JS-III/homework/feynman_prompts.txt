Arrays

Arrays are a special kind of variable where the name of the variable belongs to
multiple similar values. They are often used together with For loops to run the
same instructions with many different arguments. Arrays can be small or very large,
and each value in the array can be accessed with the same variable name by using
the "index" of the value.
