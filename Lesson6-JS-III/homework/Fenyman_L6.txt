Arrays..

Oftentimes we can observe that there are information/values which are similar or related in a meaningful way. For example the names of students in a class. A list of favourite ice creams etc...

An array is a way to structure this data. For example 
const icecreamFlavours = ['Green Tea', 'Belgium Chocolate', 'Rum and Raisin'];

So instead of this information being only in our head, this is now made obvious or explicit both to the computer as well as to other people.

Here are some benefits we get as a result:
1) this array can also be meaningfully ordered if desired. For example, by virtue of being the first item, 'Green Tea' is our favourite followed by 'Belgium Chocolate'. 
2) Arrays are can be accessed via their position (index) and this starts from 0 (as a matter of the historical convention in computer lore)
  so first flavour is
   icecreamFlavours[0]; // gives us 'Green Tea'
3) As this is such a common data strucutre, we get useful functions such as shift & unshift, push & pop. This allows us to add and remove values from the beginning and end of the array.
4) The presence of an array index, makes if convenient for us to write code snippets, which repeat for each item of the array. A useful way is to use a for loop. The counter in the loop can nicely dovetail with the index of the array. e.g. 0,1,2,3,4 until the (length of the array - 1) The minus one accounts for the fact that the index of the array starts from 0.
