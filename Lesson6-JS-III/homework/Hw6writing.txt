# arrays
In JavaScript, an array allows us to store many values of the same type. 
For instance, if we wanted to store a list of all the basketball players at the school, we might use an array.
let players = ['James', 'Cynthia', 'Jim', 'Dan', 'Amelia', 'Larry', 'Michael']
Each item in the array has a value starting with 0. In the example above, James is in the 0 spot. Cynthia is in the 1 spot. 
Jim is in the 2 spot. Etc. 
We can access Jim in the above array like this:
players[2]
The name of the array is "players" and Jim is in the 2 spot (the 3rd item).
