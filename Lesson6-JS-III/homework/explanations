Arrays - an array is like a variable that can hold a whole collection of things. With variables, each variable corresponds to a single item (string, number, true, false, etc.). So if you had a whole list of names, each one would get its own variable. Or you could make an array to collect all of the names in one giant container.

If you want to pull out a single item from an array, you need to address it by the order in which it is listed. So if you had 3 cats named Moxie, Starbuck, and Mandy, you could make an array for them like this:
const catNames = ['Moxie', 'Starbuck', "Mandy'];
And then if you later want to pull Moxie's name, you would call for catNames[0] (people start counting with 1 but apparently, machines start counting with 0).

Arrays are easy to edit - you can change a name entirely, and add one or remove one from either end.
