Arrays are like an organized train, where each wagon is added to the end of the current train. It's easy to access the first and last wagon. 

We have commands to add/remove the first wagon '.unshift' / '.shift'
We also have ones that add/remove the last one '.push'    / '.pop'

Much like trains, in Javascript don't have any requirements as to what each compartment can hold, an array can have multiple data types within it.

A good way to iterate through each wagon sequentially is to use of a for loop.
