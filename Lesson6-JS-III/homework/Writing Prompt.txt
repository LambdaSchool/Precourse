#arrays

An array is a collection of items, kept in order. Since they are kept in order, you just have to know what number your item is at in order, and then the array will tell you what the item is. The tricky thing is that the array keeps track of the items starting at 0, and counting up from there. So if you want the first item in the array, you have to ask the array for item 0, and for the second, you ask for item 1. And for the fiftieth, you'd ask for Item 49. Basically, whichever item you want, you ask the array for 1 less. 

The array also has ways you can change it around, as well as providing information, but you have to request it to help you in a specific way. The array allows you to add items to the end by asking it to "push" the item. And it can get rid of the last item if you ask it to "pop" the item. It will add an item to the beginning for you if you tell it to "shift" that item, and it can remove the first item for you if you tell it to "unshift". The array can also always tell you how items are in it if you ask it for its length. There are other things arrays can tell you about their contents, and other tasks they can perform, but those are the most important ones.
