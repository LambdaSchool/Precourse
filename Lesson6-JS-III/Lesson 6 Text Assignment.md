1. Arrays - An array is a way of storing multiple pieces of data as a single variable. It's a container that holds multiple pieces. Generally these pieces are all correllated as some type of list (ex: types of cars), however, they do not have to be (ex: email address and phone number for a contact). You can add or delete data from an array.
