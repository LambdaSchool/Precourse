	* `for`
    A structure that will allow you to loop through a block of code. 
    It has inputs of an initial condition, a condition under which
    the loop will operate, and a [final condition of a loop iteration], 
    which is typically an increment or decriment condition.

	* `&&`
    And logical operator. If both inputs are true the output is true,
    otherwise the output is false.

  * `||`
    Or logical operator. If both inputs are false the output will be 
    false, otherwise the output will be true.

  * `!`
    Not logical operator. Negates the value. !true = false; 
    !false = true.
