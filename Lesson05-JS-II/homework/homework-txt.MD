1) For loops are used to repeat conditions we set to repeat until it reaches a desired amount of repetition that we want it to repeat. For loops can avoid us from writing repeatedly code over and over.

2) && is the AND logical operator. We use use this operator to check if expressions is true or false. Both sides of the && must evaluate to true for the condition to be true. If either side is false the whole expression will become false. Ex. true && true === true. false && true === false.

3) || is the OR logical operator. We use this operator to check if either side of a expression is true. If either side is true the whole expression will become true. Both sides must be false for the condition to evaluate to false. Ex. true || false === true. false || false === false.

4) ! is the NOT logical operator. The not operator returns the opposite value that is put in front of !. Ex. !true === false. !false === true.
