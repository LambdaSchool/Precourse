1) For loops are used to iterate over conditions a known amount of times. We can use for loops to iterate over a known amount of numbers or we can also use for loops to iterate over an array and gain access to every element in an array instead of logging them one by one.

2) && is the AND logical operator. The &&(AND) operator is used to check if both sides of a condition is true or false. Both sides of the condition must evaluate to true for it to be true. If one side is false the whole condition will evaluate to false.
Example: true && true === true, true && false === false, false && false === false. The || is the OR logical operator. The ||(OR) operator is used to check if either side of the condition is true. If one side is true and the other side is false the condition will still remain true. For it to evaluate to false both sides need to be false. Example: false || true === true, true || true === true, false || false === false. The ! is the NOT operator. It will make a condition the opposite of its actual boolean value. Example: !true will evaluate to false and !false will evaluate to true.
