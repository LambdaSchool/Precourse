1.) "For" is a type of loop which can repeat a command any number of times. A common use is to iterate through 
a collection of items. It has three parts: the initialization of a counter, the condition for it to keep running, and
something that increases the counter.


2.) "&&" means the logical "And" which in conditionals means both sides of the and must be true for the conditional
to be true. Both sides result in booleans as does the whole expression. "||" is the logical "Or" and means that one 
or both of the sides of the conditional must be true for the whole expression to be true. "!" means "Not" and it will
reverse the truthiness of the expression, so "true" becomes "false" and vice versa.
