Feynman prompts

When you have logical operators you use symbols to set condtions for the equation you are working on. 

1. && 
    the symbol && is use to say that both sides of the equation must be true. 
    For example, 10 < 100 && 5 > 2
    both of these are true - so your conditon is met and will output "True".
    (BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION MUST BE MET FOR THE OPPORATION TO PASS AS TRUE)


2. ||
    the symbol || is used to say that one side or the other must be true.
    For example, 10 < 100 || 5 > 20
    10 is larger than 100 so that means true but 5 is not larger than 20. 
    It will still pass the conditon and run true because one of them is accurate.
    (THE PROGRAM WILL READ AND OR STATEMENT UNTIL IT GETS IT'S "TRUE" -- MEANING THAT IT DIDNT CHECK THE 2ND CONDITON.
    IT SAW THE 1ST ONE WAS CORRECT AND PASSED THE OPPORATION AS "TRUE")

3. ! 
The symbol ! is used to repersent not. It was says that whatever you put the ! infront of it will render the opposite.
For example, !True = False and !False = True.


A. for
The word for in Javascript used to start a for-loop.
A for loop  is a control flow statement  that allows a the code to run as long as it passes as true.
