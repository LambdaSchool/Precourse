For:
a 'for' loop is like saying. "for every time this thing happense, do this." So how that would sound after it's been used could be; "For every time
an item in a list isn't apples, print "NO! I don't want that!"

&&:
The '&&' symbol looks ugly and weird, but all it's saying is "and", and that's easy to remember by thinking of Jack&TheBox, that '&' means "and." So in 
programming all you do is use two of them to say "and".

||:
The '||' symbol also looks ugly and weird, but this one means "or". Now that can be hard to remember because this is just two straight lines. But try to remember
"or" in programming as those two lines that don't resemble the concept of "or"
one bit.

!:
the "!" in programming is very easy to remember. Think of it as a stop sign or
warning whenever you see it because it literally means "not", like "1 != 2". or
"One is not equal to two."
