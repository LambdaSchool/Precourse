1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for` â€” A basic loop statement that has a starting point, how far to continue doing the described behavior, and how to increment. 
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` - These are logical operators! They signify the following:
        '&&' means AND (letting you know that multiple things need to be true to continue);
        '||' means OR (letting you know that continuing can happen if one of the things is true);
        '!' means NOT (signaling the thing being not true; for instance, if the 'thing' is 'red' then '!thing' would be 'not red').
