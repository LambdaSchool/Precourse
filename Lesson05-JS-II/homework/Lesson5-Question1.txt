A for loop is a repeating program.  You set where the program starts; when it continues until; and what same action it performs each time it runs.  It is important to instruct it to end, otherwise is will continue infinitely.  

'&&' is used to compare two conditions, where the first condition AND the second have to true to continue on.

'||' compares 2 conditions, where either the first condition OR second can be true to continue on.

'!' is considered NOT.  It will change the condition to the opposite.  !true would be changed to a condition of false.
