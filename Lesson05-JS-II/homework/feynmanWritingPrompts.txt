for {
    The 'for loop' is a special and fundamental type of function that repeats a set of rules a given number of times. For example, suppose you want to write a program that simulates eating a pizza with 8 slices. You could use a 'for loop' to simulate eating 1 slice of pizza each time the 'for loop' runs. Set up a for loop to run 8 times, and suddenly you've simulated eating a whole pizza!

&& {
    '&&' is a logical operator that compares whether 2 statements are both true.
}

|| {
    '||' is a logical operator that compares whether either one of 2 statements is true.
} 

! {
    '!' is a logical operator that turns a boolean value into its opposite. So if a statement is true, the '!' logical operator would turn the statement false and change the flow of the program.
