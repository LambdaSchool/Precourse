Explain the following concepts like you are explaining them to a 12 year old:

FOR
For is a Javascript keyword that begins what is called a loop. A loop is a
set of instructions the programmer tells the computer to repeat. That is a neat
ability because it allows the programmer to perform repetitive tasks over and
over.

Programmers should give for loops limits when they write them, otherwise a loop
can continue on and on and on forever, and that would be bad for the computer!


OPERATORS && , || , !
The above are called logical operators. Think of each one as a keyword for
words you already know. Think of && as "and", think of || as "or", and think of
! as "not".

&& is "and". We use it to tell the computer to evaluate two expressions and
return "true" if and only if both expressions are true. If one expression is
false, the entire && statement is false.

|| is "or". We use it to tell the computer to evaluate two expressions and to
return "true" if at least one of the expressions is true.

! is "not". Think of it as the negative sign in math. If you have four, and then
put "-" in front of it, you now have -4. Now, if you put another negative sign
in front of -4, you get --4 and that's equal to 4. ! behaves the same way in
Javascript. It returns the opposite boolean result, so true becomes false and
false becomes true.
