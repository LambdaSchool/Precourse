## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`
for loops are a way to run a block of code until a condition is met, very useful for looping through an array, for example.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`
&& - this is the and operator, if you want to check a certain value or var meets two conditions, for example 5 is greater than 4 and less than 6
|| - this is the or operator, you can use this to check if something is this OR that.
! - this is signifies if something is not, for example 1 !== 2

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
