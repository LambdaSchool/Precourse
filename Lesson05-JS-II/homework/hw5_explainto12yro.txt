- for // The for-loop is like a simple program for javascript, that tells the computer to check if a certain condition has been met. If the condition has not been met
the program will run over and over again until the condition is fufilled. The syntax to setup a for loop is, declaring that it will be a for loop by the word itself.
Then parentheses, then open and closed brackets. In the parentheses there are three  things that are required for the program to run correctly. Declaring a variable,
by setting the variable to equal something. a condition, so once that condition becomes false, the loops stops, and an increment operator that increments the variable.
Within the brackets we write the code that will be looped.

- && // The and logical operator compares two expressions. Expressions are like comparisons, numbers are compared through larger or less than or equal symbols. 
If both expressions are true then the entire statement becomes true, if one of the expressions are false, the entire statement is false. Javascript skips redundencies 
so if the first expression is false, the entire expression will be false.

- || // The or logical operator is similar to the and logical operator but only cares if one expression is true. This will make the entire statement true.
In addition to this, the same redundency rule applies, so if one expression is true it will not read the second expression.

- ! // The not logical operator will return the opposite value of what is stated. Compared to the previous two logical operator it only evaluates one expression,
but it will output the opposite statement. A simple example would be (!(0===0)), because 0 does equal 0 this statement is true, but because of the not operator,
the entire statement will be false.
