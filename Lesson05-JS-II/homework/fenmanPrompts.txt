	* `for`
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`

for loops are a way to run a block of code multiple times as long as the conditions put into it remain true.

'&&' is the comparison operator for 'and'. You use it to add two boolean requirements.
example (true && true) === true
		(true && false) === false
		(false && false) === false

'||' is the comparison operator for 'or'. You use it between two boolean comparisons. the code as a result will
run if either of the conditions are met
example (true || true) === true 
		(true || false) === true
		(false || fales) === false

'!' is the not operator. It is used to reverse the boolean statement or a statement that would evaluate to a boolean
example(!true) === false
	   (!false) === true
