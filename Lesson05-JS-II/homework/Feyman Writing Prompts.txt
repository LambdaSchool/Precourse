'For' let us loop a block of code for a known amount of time. It start with an initial value, then increase by an amount to the limit.

&& and || are logical operators used to connect to boolean conditions. 
When we need both conditions to be true or both conditions to be false, we use &&.
When we need either condition to be true or false, we use ||

! is the logical not operator. It takes an expression and evaluates it. If expression is true, then return false, and vice versa.11
